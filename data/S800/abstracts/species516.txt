Rhizomastix biflagellata sp. nov., a new amoeboflagellate of uncertain phylogenetic position isolated from frogs. 

The genus Rhizomastix contains five species of amoeboflagellates with a single anterior flagellum, which live as intestinal symbionts of insects and amphibians. Though established in 1911, Rhizomastix has been neglected for decades and its phylogenetic position is uncertain. This paper describes the morphology of the first cultivated strain of Rhizomastix. The organism was isolated from an argentine horned frog and differs from the known Rhizomastix species by the presence of biflagellate cells. The isolate is described as Rhizomastix biflagellata sp. nov. A possible relationship of Rhizomastix to Archamoebae is discussed.
