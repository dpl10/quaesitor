Marinobacterium coralli sp. nov., isolated from mucus of coral (Mussismilia hispida). 

A Gram-negative, aerobic bacterium, designated R-40509(T), was isolated from mucus of the reef builder coral (Mussismilia hispida) located in the Sao Sebastiao Channel, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The strain was oxidase-positive and catalase-negative, and required Na(+) for growth. Its phylogenetic position was in the genus Marinobacterium and the closest related species were Marinobacterium sediminicola, Marinobacterium maritimum and Marinobacterium stanieri; the isolate exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.5-98.0 % with the type strains of these species. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with other type strains of the genus Marinobacterium were below 96 %. DNA-DNA hybridizations between strain R-40509(T) and the type strains of the phylogenetically closest species of the genus Marinobacterium revealed less than 70 % DNA-DNA relatedness, supporting the novel species status of the strain. Phenotypic characterization revealed that the strain was able to grow at 15-42 ^0C and in medium containing up to 9 % NaCl. The isolate could be differentiated from phenotypically related species by several features, including its ability to utilize d-alanine, l-alanine, bromosuccinic acid, Beta-hydroxybutyric acid and alpha-ketovaleric acid, but not acetate or l-arabinose. It produced acetoin (Voges-Proskauer), but did not have esterase lipase (C8) or catalase activities. It possessed C(18 : 1)omega7c (35 %), summed feature 3 (iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c; 25 %) and C(16 : 0) (22 %) as major cellular fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 58.5 mol%. The name Marinobacterium coralli sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate this novel isolate; the type strain is R-40509(T) (=LMG 25435(T) =CAIM 1449(T)).
