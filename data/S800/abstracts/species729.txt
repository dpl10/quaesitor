Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. 

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with multiple human malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Following primary infection, KSHV typically goes through a brief period of lytic replication prior to the establishment of latency. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the major producers of type 1 interferon (IFN), primarily in response to virus infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system, and they serve as pathogen recognition receptors that stimulate the host antiviral response. pDCs express exclusively TLR7 and TLR9, and it is through these TLRs that the type 1 interferon response is activated in pDCs. Currently, it is not known whether KSHV is recognized by pDCs and whether activation of pDCs occurs in response to KSHV infection. We now report evidence that KSHV can infect human pDCs and that pDCs are activated upon KSHV infection, as measured by upregulation of CD83 and CD86 and by IFN-alpha secretion. We further show that induction of IFN-alpha occurs through activation of TLR9 signaling and that a TLR9 inhibitor diminishes the production and secretion of IFN-alpha by KSHV-infected pDCs.
