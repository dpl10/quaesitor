Natural history and intragenomic dynamics of the Transib transposon Hztransib in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa zea. 

Hztransib, recently identified from Helicoverpa zea, represents the first intact and transcriptionally active Transib element. Its open reading frame was detected in Helicoverpa armigera, from which H. zea evolved, and in Helicoverpa assulta, the common ancestor of H. zea and H. armigera, but its remaining parts were found only in H. armigera. Thirty-nine Hztransib insertion sites, all of which are polymorphic, were detected from eight populations of H. zea. Out of the 39 insertion sites, 35 were not frequently occupied, with 1-33 occurrences in a total of 128 individuals from the eight populations (16 larvae per population). Its copy number ranged from 5.8 to 14.2 per individual, with putative intact copies always more abundant than internally deleted ones. Taking this evidence together, Hztransib probably transferred to H. zea from H. armigera and most likely still retains its capacity to maintain structural integrity, increase copy number and remobilize in H. zea.
