Gel-based mass spectrometric and computational approaches to the mitochondrial proteome of Neurospora. 

We have used gel electrophoretic techniques including isoelectric focusing, blue native, acid-urea, 16-benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride or SDS first dimensions and SDS Laemmli or tricine second dimensions to separate the proteins from highly-purified Neurospora mitochondria and sub-mitochondrial fractions (membrane, soluble, protein complexes and ribonucleoproteins). The products of 260 genes, many of them in multiple processed or modified forms, were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This work confirms the existence, expression, and mitochondrial localization of the products of 55 Neurospora genes previously annotated only as predicted or hypothetical, and of 101 genes not identified in previous mass spectrometry studies. Combined with previous mass spectrometry studies, and re-evaluation of genome annotations, we have compiled a curated list of 358 proteins identified in proteomic studies that are likely to be bona fide mitochondrial proteins plus 80 other identified proteins that may be mitochondrial. Literature data mining and computational predictions suggest that Neurospora mitochondria also contain another 299 proteins not yet identified in proteomics projects. Taken together, these data suggest that the products of at least 738 genes comprise the Neurospora mitochondrial proteome.
