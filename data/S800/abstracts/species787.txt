Streptomyces hyderabadensis sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from soil.

A novel actinomycete, designated strain OU-40(T), was isolated from farm soil collected from the Hyderabad region of Andhra Pradesh, southern India. The strain was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of species of the genus Streptomyces. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain OU-40(T) belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and was related most closely to Streptomyces pactum NBRC 13433(T) (99.0 % sequence similarity), Streptomyces olivaceus NBRC 12805(T) (99.0 %) and Streptomyces parvulus NBRC 13193(T) (98.8 %). Strain OU-40(T) could be distinguished from the type strains of its closest phylogenetic relatives based on levels of DNA-DNA relatedness and comparison of morphological and phenotypic data. It is therefore concluded that strain OU-40(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces hyderabadensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OU-40(T) (=CCTCC AA 209024(T) =PCM 2692(T)).
