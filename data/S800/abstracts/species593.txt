Orientation of SecA and SecB in complex, derived from disulfide cross-linking.

SecA is the ATPase that acts as the motor for protein export in the general secretory, or Sec, system of Escherichia coli. The tetrameric cytoplasmic chaperone SecB binds to precursors of exported proteins before they can become stably folded and delivers them to SecA. During this delivery step, SecB binds to SecA. The complex between SecA and SecB that is maximally active in translocation contains two protomers of SecA bound to a tetramer of SecB. The aminoacyl residues on each protein that are involved in binding the other have previously been identified by site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy; however, that study provided no information concerning the relative orientation of the proteins within the complex. Here we used our extensive collection of single-cysteine variants of the two proteins and subjected pairwise combinations of SecA and SecB to brief oxidation to identify residues in close proximity. These data were used to generate a model for the orientation of the two proteins within the complex.
