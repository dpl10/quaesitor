Oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma: which therapeutic approach?

Gastric and oesophageal cancers are among the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. By contrast with the decreasing prevalence of gastric cancer, incidence and prevalence of oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (OGJA) are rising rapidly in developed countries. We provide an update about treatment strategies for resectable OGJA. Here we review findings from the latest randomised trials and meta-analyses, and propose guidelines regarding endoscopic, surgical, and perioperative treatments. Through a team approach, members from all diagnostic and therapeutic disciplines, such as gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and radiotherapists, can effectively administer a range of treatment modalities.
