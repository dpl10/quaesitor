xiii, c. 3 Foxworthy: Philippine Dipterocarpaceae, II 189 of the flowers; and the almost or complete absence of a style. It differs from S. cihata in the broader leaves, which are rounded at the base-and m the petals, ovary and style. It is further represented by the following specimens : 6 Mindanao, Zamboanga Province, For. Bur. 28:886, 28885 21992 21999 VMamil, May, 1914, For. Bur. 13287 Foxworthy, De Mesa, & Villamil, May, 1912; Agusan Province, For. Bur. 2U88 Miras, Soriano, & Mariano-Luzon Camarines Province, For. Bur. 21US2, 2U60 Alvarez, May, 1914. 4. SHOREA MALIBATO Foxw. in Leafl. Phil. Bot. 6 (1913) 1955. This is represented by the original collection from Agusan Province Mindanao. The leaves resemble those of Shorea ciliata, but the fruit is smaller and the long calyx-lobes have more numerous longitudinal nerves For. Bur. 22786 Miranda, collected in Zamboanga Province, Mindanao, August 17, 1914, under the name of guijo amarillo, has fruit which seems to be intermediate between that of Shorea malibato and S. ciliata The fruit is slightly larger than that of S. ciliata and the wings are those of S. malibato. 5. SHOREA FALCIFEROIDES sp. nov. Yamban matibia (Zambales). Arbor magna. Foliis et f ructibus 5. falciferae similis sed foliis majoribus et fructibus minoribus. A large tree with oblong to oblong-lanceolate, coriaceous leaves which are glabrous or nearly so and dark green above, distinctly lighter and finely pubescent beneath, 8.5 to 12 cm long, 3 to 6 cm wide, rather abruptly blunt acuminate at apex, rounded at base; secondary veins 12 to 14 pairs, occasionally with domatia in the axils of some of the lower veins, tertiary veins not conspicuous ; petiole 15 to 20 mm long, grayish pubescent, as are also the twigs and the branches of the flower clusters. Stipules small, deciduous. Fruit conical gray pubescent, tapering into the hairy* persistent style, 7 to 8 mm in diameter and 7 to 10 mm tall. The three long calyx-lobes 4 to 5 cm long, 10 to 12 mm wide, grayish pubescent, oblanceolate, with 8 to 10 principal longitudinal veins and numerous irregular cross-veins, the short wings 2.5 to 3 cm long, 2 to 3 mm wide, oblanceolate, with about the same number of longitudinal veins as the larger wings. Flowers unknown. Luzon, Zambales Province, Masinloc, For. Bur. 2566U Mayor, June 8 1916 (type). This form resembles Shorea falcifera Dyer but has larger and differently shaped leaves, with a greater number of veins and smaller fruits. The wood is said to be of very good quality and to be used for structural work. 6. SHOREA MALAANONAN (Blanco) Blume in Mus. Lugd. Bat. 2 (1852) 34; Foxw. in Phil. Journ. Sci. 6 (1911) Bot. 270. Mocanera malaanonan Blanco, Fl. Filip. (1837) 858. Dipterocarpus malaanonan Blanco, Fl. Filip. ed. 2 (1845) 312. This species is still but little known. Blanco's description is not a close one and the material referred to this species presents considerable variation. Other species that have been considered as belonging here are Parashorea
