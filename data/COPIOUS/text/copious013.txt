Type locality. â€” Cape of Good Hope to Philippine Islands, and further east toward the south pole and Straits of Magellan. Mindanao (Elera).
SPECIES ERRONEOUSLY CREDITED TO THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS BY ELERA.
In his Catalogo Sistematico de Toda la Fauna de Filipinas, Casto de Elera records from definite islands many species of mammals which simply do not and never have occurred there. These records are probably based on misidentified specimens, as nearly all are listed as represented in the collection of the Colegio-universidad de Santo Tomas de Manila. Some of them obviously represent species since described from the Philippines, which he had confounded with Indian or Chinese forms and are thus accounted for in the present list. The records which I have ignored as quite impossible, or too improbable for serious consideration without better evidence, are listed below. Doubtless a few of these species, or their local representatives, especially certain of the bats, will eventually prove to inhabit the Islands.
