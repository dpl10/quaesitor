178 The Philippine Journal of Science distinctly turbinate. Wings 11 to 13 cm long, 3 cm wide, with three principal longitudinal veins and numerous irregularly branched lateral veins. The short wings are very inconspicuous enlargements of the rim of the calyx-tube. Luzon, Tayabas Province, Pagbilao, For. Bur. 23841 F. Manuel, August 6, 1914 (type). Said to be known locally as apitong. This plant was represented by fragmentary material collected by Mr. H. M. Curran in Sorsogon Province, Luzon, in 1909. It was mentioned by me in 1911, 4 but it was not until 1914 that enough material was obtained for a full diagnosis. The following are referred here: Luzon, Laguna Province, For. Bur. 8864, 10074, 19261 Curran: Tayabas Province, For. Bur. s. n., For. Bur. 3223 Hagger, For. Bur. 6045 Kobbe, For. Bur. 12500 Rosenbluth: Albay Province, Cuming 881: Sorsogon Province, For Bur. 1056 U Curran. This species seems to be fairly common in dense forests on low ridges in some parts of Tayabas Province. 10. DIPTEROCARPUS OBCONICUS Foxw. in Leafl. Phil. Bot. 6 (1913) 1951. The leaf-form, venation, and hairiness of buds correspond very closely to those of Dipterocarpus gracilis Blume, as figured in Fl. Javae, t. 5. It is characterized by its fruit which has an obconical base. Mindanao, Agusan Province, Cabadbaran, Elmer 13498, August, 1912 (type), at 230 meters elevation. 11. DIPTEROCARPUS CUNEATUS sp. nov. Arbor magna, D. obconico similis sed glabra, petiolo longiore et calycis segmentis longioribus. Closely related to D. obconicus Foxw., but differing from that species by being glabrous, by having more slender and longer petioles, and by the narrower and longer fruit-wings. A large tree. Leaves elliptic, glabrous, 6 to 12 cm long, 2.9 to 7 cm wide, abruptly acuminate at apex, cuneate at base, margin crenulate and slightly inrolled, glabrous throughout. Secondary veins 10 to 14 pairs. Petioles 16 to 32 mm long, slender. Buds glabrous, elongate. Fruit obconic 22 to 23 mm long, 16 to 18 mm in diameter. Long wings oblanceolate, 11 to 13 cm long, 2 to 2.5 cm wide. Three principal longitudinal veins and numerous oblique and transverse veins. Luzon, Camarines Province, Mount Sanot, For. Bur. 21469 Alvarez, May 24, 1914 (type). Common name, panalsalan. 12. DIPTEROCARPUS WARBURGII Brandis; Foxworthy in Leafl Phil Bot. 6 (1913) 1952. Balaou (Manobo). Mindanao, Agusan and Davao. Luzon, Cagayan Province. 13. DIPTEROCARPUS SPECIOSUS Brandis. This species is sufficiently variable in its fruit to permit of its being 4 Phil. Journ. Sci. 6 (1911) Bot. 247, t. 39.
