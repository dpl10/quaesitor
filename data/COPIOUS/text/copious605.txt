ON "HABU" VENOM AND ITS SERUM THERAPY.
By T. Kitajima. 1 (From the Institute for Infections Diseases, Tokyo, Japan)
INTRODUCTION.
Few species of venomous snakes are native to Japan, the main island, Nippon or Hondo, being inhabited only by the relatively harmless Trigonocephalies Bromlioffi. But the islands Eiukiu (Loo Choo) and Amami (Oshima) are scourged by the fierce snake termed "habu' This species inflicts no little damage upon the population, either killing its victims outright or at least debilitating them seriously. The following table gives the number of eases occurring annually.

This table shows that 2,028 persons were bitten by this serpent during the past nine years ; of this number 263 died, an average of 225 cases with 29 deaths for each year, the death rate being 129 per cent. About the same number of cases has been reported from the Riukiu Islands; that is, about 200 a year.
