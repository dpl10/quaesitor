NOTES ON DIPTEROCARPS. 73 The next Shorea to be illustrated is Shorea sericea, Dyer. Like Shorea rigida, Brandis, from which as a species it is doubtfully distinct, it has nearly equal cotyledons, the outer only just the larger, of the same shape, as those of Shorea rigida (vide this Journal No. 76, 1917, p. 164), One case of a seedling with three nearly equal cotyledons was found in Penang. Figure 186, the fruit of Shorea sericea germinating, 1/2 nat, size ; figure 187 seedling with its ootyledons in the position that they assume, slightly reduced Figure 188, an embryo of Shorea sericea seen with the radicle away from the observer ; figure 189, the outer cotyledon seen from the outer side; and figure 190, the inner cotyledon seen from the side away from the outer cotyledon. Figures 189 and 190, 1/2 nat. size. Shorea sericea flowered in 1918 in Penang a couple of months later than the other Shoreas associated with it. The last of the seedling Shoreas to be illustrated here is S. bracteolata, Dyer. Other species illustrated above have thick cotyledons: they have been arranged into a series commencing with those having cotyledons markedly unequal, and ending with those having cotyledons equal. S. oracteolata does not fit into the series, but like S. leprosula has flat cotyledons. Attention was called to them in this Journal No. 76, 1917, p. 164, where the cotyledons of S. leprosula were described. Unlike S. leprosula it has a large flower directed earthwards. R. A. Soc, No. 81, 1920.
