GEOLOGIC RECONNAISSANCE OF MINDANAO AND SULU. 479
V. CLIMATE.
It is difseiilt to discuss the meteorology conditions of Mindanao in a general way. The fairly regular and distinctly marked seasons which prevail in Luzon do not seem to obtain in Mindanao. The following table is taken from the monthly reports of the Philippine Weather Bureau
Rainfall, in millimeters, at Mindanao and Still stations during 1905.

A great difference is shown between the rainfall at Zamboanga, at Surigao and at Davao, and the results are very evident in the difference between the forests of these portions of the island. Zamboanga Peninsula is fairly well forested, if the plain which has been cultivated for a long time is excepted, but the forest of this region is not by any means as luxuriant as that of the Agusan and Davao Valleys. The densest forests in the Philippine Islands, with the possible exception of portions of Mindoro, are probably to be found in the latter districts.
I was not in the country for a sufficient length of time to render any statement I might make in regard to the healthfulness of various parts of Mindanao of value. The low country in the river valleys and the lake region to the south of the Cotabato is probably not as healthful as the highlands of the Lanao region. Mosquitoes abound in many parts of the former territory and great precautions must be taken against them. The Cotabato River has a particularly bad, but I think unreserved, reputation in this respect. I had no fever nor any sickness whatever during the five months I was in Mindanao, but both native and American troops have suffered considerably from malaria.
A table of the temperatures for the various stations of the island follows
