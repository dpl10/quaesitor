PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 285 

fine-grained, red wood. The leaves have a shape very much like that of some species of Dryobalanops, but the venation is different. Bur. Sci. 13141 Foxworthy & Ramos, collected near the Kabibihan River, in the Province of Tayabas, Luzon, in March 1911, under the name of paina. This number has immature fruit, unlike anything else that I have seen. The leaves and wood resemble Hopea plagata. 

EXCLUDED SPECIES. F.-Villar in Noviss. App. 20-21, credits Shorea floribunda Kurz, S. parvifolia DC, S. reticulata Thwaites, Vatica grandiflora Dyer, V. scaphula Dyer, V. affinis Thwaites, to the Philippines, but without citing specimens. It seems safe to assume that he was mistaken in crediting these species to the Islands.
