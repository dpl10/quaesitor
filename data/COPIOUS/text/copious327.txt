Andaman : Kurz, King's Collector. This closely resembles D. grandiflorus, Blanco, but the two may be readily distinguished by their young branches and leaf-buds. The young branches of this species are pale canescent and its leaf-buds broad and golden sericeous ; while the branchlets of D. grandiflorus are quite glabrous and dark-coloured and the buds are narrow and pale canescent. 12. Dipterocarpus incanus, Roxb. Hort. Beng. 42 ; Fl. Ind. II. 614. A tall tree : young shoots terete, stout, densely but minutely tawny-tomentose ; the buds short, ovoid, thick, with longer tomentum than the branchlets. Leaves coriaceous, broadly ovate, acute or sub-acute, the base rounded or sub-cordate, the edges undulate ; upper surface glabrous, the midrib alone slightly pubescent : under surface uniformly pale, shortly but softly stellate-pubescent, the midrib and nerves tomentose . main nerves 12 to 15 pairs, oblique, straight, prominent on the lower surface ; length 5 to 8 in.,breadth 2 -5 to 4 -75 in. ; petiole '8 to 1*25 in., pubescent. Flowers about 1 in. long, usually in racemes but occasionally in short 7-or 8-flowered panicles. Calyx-tube ob-conic, 5-winged, minutely tomentose. Petals oblong, obtuse. Fruit sub-globose, about 1 in. in diam., 5-winged from base to apex ; the wings thin, from -25 to '5 in. broad ; the 2 accrescent lobes of the calyx narrowly oblong, obtuse, glabrous, much reticulate, 3-nerved in the lower half, when mature 5 -5 in. long and nearly 1.5 in. broad ; the 3 minor lobes sub-orbicular.
