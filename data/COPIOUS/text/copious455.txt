318 Menyak Keruing, Dipterocarpus crinitus and Hasseltii. Calophyllum spectabile ... August to September. Petaling Ochanostachys Amentacea ... July to September. Tembusu, Fagroea fragrans ... November Merbau, Afzelia palembanica Palaquium was not observed to fruit in Negri Sembilan. It is interesting to note that in the forests near Tertang, Jelebu, the various ages or girth classes of Penak and Merbau are well represented, quite in contrast to parts of Pahang and Kwala Pilah where there are but few poles and saplings. Both Merbau and Chengal seeded well in Pahang, but seedlings are reported as scarce in a more advanced age. Resak (Shorea barbata) in the Temerloh district and Giam in the Rompin district have reproduced themselves satisfactorily, and seedlings of both species were seen thriving. The reproduction of Shoreas was good.
