Vatica.] Dipterocarpaceae. 127 pubescence beneath, lat. veins very numerous, connected by loops near the margin, petiole | in., rugose ; fl. rather large, nearly sessile, in small axillary and terminal tomentose spicate panicles much shorter than the 1., bracts large, | in., acute, tomentose ; sep. tomentose ; nut spherical, \ in., very hairy, loosely surrounded by irregularly enlarged, erect, pubescent sep., the 2 largest 2 in., linear, obtuse, 3-veined, the others f-i|in., lanceolate, acute. Moist low country ; rare. Hiniduma Pattu ; Hewesse ; Pasdun Korale ; Lanegal Kanda, near Pelmadulla (F. Lewis). Fl. April. Endemic. I have not seen mature fls. The fruit was obtained at Hewesse in June. Wood heavy, hard, smooth, pale greyish-yellow. The leaves of young trees attain very much larger dimensions than those above given. Pierre (1. c. sub t. 237) erroneously refers this to Stemonoporus.

A large tree, young branches finely tomentose ; 1. 4-5 in., lanceolate-oblong, obtuse at base, attenuate, acute, glabrous, coriaceous, lat. veins about 11, conspicuous on both surfaces, petiole I in., thick, rugose ; fl. in short, erect, axillary panicles, bracts large, \-\ in., ovate, distichous, imbricate at first, tomentose, soon falling ; fruit not seen. Moist low country ; very rare. Hinduma Pattu and Pasdun Korale i(Thwaites). The C. P. specimens are from ' Lanegal Kanda, March, 1861, and are in bud only. Until further material is obtained the genus of this plant is quite uncertain. Pierre (1. c. sub t. 237) says it is a Doona near D. nervosa. 

6. VATICA, L. (sect. Isauxis, Am.). Trees ; fl. in axillary panicles ; sep. 5, slightly connected below; pet. 5 ; stam. 15, apiculate; fruit-sep. all equally and considerably enlarged but not wing-like, spreading, not imbricate or enclosing the fruit ; fruit with a thick pericarp marked with 3 grooves, indehiscent (or tardily 3-valved ?) ; cotyledons equal, thick, plano-convex, deeply divided into 2 equal lobes. â€” Sp. about 12 ; 6 in F/. B. Ind. Arnott's name Isauxis was given (Ann. Nat. Hist. iii. 155) to a section of Vateria, and was never used by him as a generic name. Stemonoporus might perhaps be combined with this, as is done by A. DC.
