Wallaceodendron Koorders
1. Wallaceodeiidrou celebica Koorders.
Luzon, Pr. Tayabas, Guinayangan (Merrill no. 2026, in fruit 1903).
From a geographical standpoint, it is interesting to observe that some plants first described as coming from Celebes are now recorded as indigenous members of the flora of the Philippine Islands. The genus Wallaceodendron was first collected by Koorders, on his trip through Minahassa, and described by him in Mededeel. van's Lands Plantentuin XV, (1898) 446 et 630. We have in the family of the Anacardiaceae a similar case, the genus Koo7dersiodendron being first discovered in Celebes, and now observed in our colony by Ahern (cf. the enumeration of the Anacardiaceae).
