104 G. King â€” Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. [.No. 2, 3. Vatica Maingayi, Dyer, in Hook, fil , Fl., Br., Ind. I, 302. A tall tree : young branches slender, ultimately glabrous, but at first rusty furfuraceous-tomentose, as are the inflorescence, calyx and ripe fruit. Leaves coriaceous, oblong or obovate-oblong, shortly acuminate, the base rounded, glabrous on both surfaces ; main nerves 9 to 12 pairs, slender, curving, spreading ; length 3 to 4*5 in., breadth 1 to 1.75 in., petiole .6 to 1.5 in. Panicles short, few-flowered. Flowers .45 in. long. Calyx-segments oblong-lanceolate. Ovary depressed, rufous-tomentose. Ripe fruit globose, .25 in. in diam., the style persistent, rufous-tomentose; free from the calyx ; the two large wings linear-oblong, sub-acute, not contracted at the base, 5-nerved (the lateral nerves faint) 2 in. long and .35 to .5 in. broad ; the 3 smaller lobes ovate, sub-acuminate, .75 in. long, all glabrous. Malacca : Maingay (Kew Distrib.) No. 209. Of this I have seen only Maingay's specimens, which are not good. 4. Vatica nitens, King, n. sp. A tree 40 to 50 feet high: young branches and petioles densely covered with coarse deciduous scaly stellate tomentum, ultimately cinereous. Leaves coriaceous, narrowly oblong, acuminate, slightly narrowed to the rounded base; both surfaces, but especially the upper, shining, glabrous, the base on the lower sparsely scaly-tomentose when young, finely reticulate; main nerves 18 to 20 pairs, spreading, prominent on the lower surface: length 9 to 10 in., breadth 2 in. ; petiole .5 in., stout. Pipe fruit globular, crowned by the persistent style, reticulate, .5 in. in diam., adnate fo half its length to the calyx ; the two large wings of the calyx oblong, slightly ob-lanceolate, obtuse, 3 in. long and .8 to .9 in. broad, the 3 shorter wings ovate-acuminate, .8 in. long; all boldly 5-nerved and shining. Penang: Curtis, No. 1404. This fine species is known only by Mr. Curtis' imperfect speci-mens. It is very distinct, being at once recognisable amongst the Indian species of Vatica by the size of its leaves and calyx-wings. 5. Vatica cinerea, King, n. sp. A tree about 40 feet high: young branches rufescent-puberulous at the very tips, otherwise glabrous and cinereous. Leaves thinly coriaceous, ovate-oblong to ovate-lanceo-late, sub-acute, the base rounded or sub-cuneate ; both surfaces glabrous, finely reticulate when dry ; main nerves 6 to 8 pairs, spreading, faint; length 2.25 to 3.5 in., breadth .75 to 1.5 in., petiole .3 to .5 in. Panicles mostly axillary, spreading, rusty scurfy-tomentose, 1.25 to 2 in. long. Flowers .45 in. long. Calyx-lobes sub-equal, lanceolate, sub-acute, tomentose on both surfaces. Petals oblong-lanceolate, sub-acute, the half of the outer surface which is outside in aestivation pubescent, other-
