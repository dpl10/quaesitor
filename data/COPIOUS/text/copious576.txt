deals only a few minor differences in morphometric characters, it is treated as a population of guentheri.
Platymantis guentheri is presently known only from the Greater Mindanao group of islands.
Platymantis guentheri (Boulenger)
Cornufer guentheri: Boulenger, 1882108 (Type loc:
Dinagat Island, Philippines; holotype in BMNH);
(part) Taylor, 1920308; and (part) Inger, 1954362.
Cornufer ingeri: Brown and Alcala, 1963672 (Type
loc: Cantaub, Bohol Island; holotype in CAS).
Platymantis guentheri: (part) Brown and Alcala,
1970b: 109.
DIAGNOSIS.
— Platymantis guentheri differs from Philippine species of the hazelae and dorsalis Groups in the combination of digital characters used to diagnose the groups (see Introduction); and from other guentheri Group species in the following combination of characters: ( 1 ) the longer tibia relative to SVL (TIL very rarely less than 57% of SVL and HW nearly always less than 75% of TIL); (2) the smaller finger disks relative to finger length (3FD 4-5% of SVL, rarely as great as 35% of 3FL and very rarely greater than 100% of TD); and (3) the
smaller size at maturity (about 2540 mm); see Tables 1, 2 and 3.
Description.
— SVL at maturity 244-332 mm for 32 males and 272-396 mm for 45 females; HW 99-112% of HL and 38-44% of SVL; snout round, pointed; upper jaw slightly protruding; SNL 35-45% of HL and 31-41% of HW; eye large; ED 71-97% of SNL, 10-13% of SVL, and 25-33% of HW; tympanum large; canthus rounded; lores concave, moderately oblique; vomerine teeth prominent; fingers without webs; digits proximal to disks about as wide as deep, with only narrow dermal flanges; first finger much shorter than second, reaching about midpoint between subarticular tubercle and disk of second; finger disks, except first, moderately large; 3FD 4-5% of SVL, 25-35% of 3FL. and 73-108% of TD; subarticular tubercles strongly protruding, usually somewhat pointed; one row of supernumerary tubercles; inner and middle metacarpal tubercles large and oval, outer smaller and round; hind limbs long as measured by tibia, TIL 56-64% of SVL and HW 63-75% of TIL; toes webbed: to proximal edge of tubercle on first and second, to various levels of basal tubercle on third, to basal tubercle on fourth, and slightly distal to the basal tubercle on the fifth;
