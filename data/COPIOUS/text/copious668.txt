Pentacme.] Dipterocarpaceae. 119 Remarks.—Wood rather light and coarse, loose-grained, brown, nebulous, []’==57pd. Wood valued equal to that of Eng, excellent for tool-handles and planes, also for canoes, &c.—Exudes white resin. N. B.—The Sâl-tree, Shorea robusta, Gaertn. (Bedd. Sylv. Madr. 26, t. 4.; Brand. For. Fl. 26, t. 9), is said to grow in Ava, but I have seen no specimens of it. 2. S. Helferi, Kz. (Vatica Helferi, Dyer; H.f. Ind. Fl. i. 302).—A tree; leaves oblong or elliptically oblong, 4-6 in. long, cordate at base, on a thick 3-4 lin. long petiole, coriaceous, blunt, glabrous above, beneath minutely silvery-puberulous, the lateral nerves numberous and prominent; flowers in bud whitish-tomentose, sessile, racemose, forming white or greyish-tomentose 2-5 in. long panicles in the axils of the leaves or almost terminal; rest unknown. Hab.—Tenasserim. S. nervosa, Kz., is another Tenasserim species, of which the flowers and fruits are still unknown. It differs from Sh. leprosula in having the upper side of the leaves not scabrous and generally in the indumentum and nervation. It yields a clear yellowish resin of the qualities and smell of colphony. 3. Sh. floribunda, Kz.; H.f. Ind. Fl. i. 304.—A leaf-shedding tree, all parts glabrous; young leaves oblong to elliptical, rounded at base, on a slender petiole 1/2-3/4 in. long, acute, 3-4 in. long, glabrous; flowers middling-sized, almost sessile, racemose, forming quite glabrous, slender panicles in the axils of the young leaves; calyx quite glabrous, the 2 inner lobes a little shorter; petals nearly 1/2 in. long, yellowish (?) lanceolate, slightly pubescent outside; sta-mens only about 15, the connective terminating into a reflexed bristle as long as the anther itself. Hab.—Tenasserim.—Fl. Decb. Pentacme, DC. Calyx imbricate, the tube very short. Petals infracted from their middle, and closely twisted round the sexual organs so as to form a closed hemispherical corolla perforated only at the top. Stamens 15; anthers 4-celled, the cells almost equal, saccate at base, tapering into subulate points, the connective also terminated by a rigid bristle. Ovary free; style filiform. Nut enclosed in the broad imbricate bases of the 5 wing-like enlarged calyx-lobes, the 2 inner wings somewhat shorter.—Large trees with entire leaves. Flowers in lax panicles. Fruits of Shorea. 1. P. Siamensis, Kz. (Shorea Siamensis, Miq.; H.f. Ind. Fl. i. 304).—Eng-kyn.—A tree (60—90+40—50+5—6), leafless during HS., the leaf-buds and sometimes the young leaves beneath covered
