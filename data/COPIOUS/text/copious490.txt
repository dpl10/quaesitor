PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 275 

glabrous within. Petals dark-red within. Flowers said to have a rather sickeningly sweet odor. Petals prominently longitudinally veined. Filaments black between the oblong anthers. Appendage to the connective tapering and shorter than the anther. Ovary bluntly conical in outline, hairy. No stylopodium. Style smooth; stigma small and obscurely lobed. One of the most important of our timber trees. The wood is very pretty, coarse-grained and moderately hard. It is sometimes exported under the name of "Philippine Mahogany.'' This tree is most abundant in the northern part of the Island of Negros, where it occurs gregariously with almon, balacbacan and bagtican. It is, perhaps, the most important commercial wood of the Philippines at the present time. The leaves of this species show close resemblances to those of S. lepidota Bl., of Sumatra, S. selanica Bl., of Amboina, and S. platycarpa Heim, of Sarawak. For.
