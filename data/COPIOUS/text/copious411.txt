1893] G. King -Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. 117 broadly ovate, acute, tomentose outside; the edges ciliate, glabrous inside. Petals linear-oblong, obtuse; the bases obliquely expanded, sericeous externally, glabrous internally. Stamens 15, sub-equal, the filaments as long as the anthers, flattened; anthers ovate, short, the connective terminated by a curved awn much longer than the stamen. Ovary elongate-conic, puberulous; style short. Ripe fruit hemispheric, tapering into a cone and crowned by the style, adpressed pale tomen-tose. Sepals membranous, reticulate: the three larger narrowly ob-long, obtuse, tapering to the concave non-reticulate base, 9-nerved, 3.5 in. long and .7 in. broad: the two inner 2 in. long, linear, 3-nerved. Perak: King's Collector, Nos. 3474 and 3705. This species is allied to S. bracteolata, Dyer, but its leaves have fewer nerves, smaller flowers, narrower petals, and a short style. 13. Shorea bracteolata, Dyer in Hook. fil. Fl. br. ind. I, 305. A tree 50 to 150 feet high; young branches minutely furfuraceous-puberulous, speedily glabrescent, their bark dark-coloured. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic-oblong, shortly acuminate (often sub-obtuse when old), narrowed slightly to the rounded or emarginate basel upper surface quite glabrous; the lower yellowish furfuraceous-puberulous to glabrous; main nerves 12 to 16 pairs, spreading, prominent beneath: length 4 to 6 in., breadth 1.6 to 2.5 in., petiole .45 to .6 in. Panicles axillary, few-flowered, 2.5 to 6 in. long, glabrous. Flowers .65 in. long, shortly pedicellate, each subtended by 2 elliptic, obtuse, 3-nerved, puberu-lous, deciduous bracts .35 in long. Speals lanceolate, obtuse, minutely tomentose outside, the two inner smaller. Petals ovate-lanceolate, obtuse; the bases expanded, glabrous. Stamens 15, in two rows, the filaments less than half as long as the ovate obtuse anthers; appendix of connective subulate, twice as long as the anther, decurved when old. Ovary ovoid, attenuated upwards, sub-glabrous; the style long, filiform; stigma small. Ripe fruit ovoid, apiculate, .6 in. long, embraced by, but (except at the very base) free from the calyx; sepals accrescent, mem-branous, reticulate and concave at the base: the three outer narrwoly oblong, blunt, slightly narrowed above the concave base, 10-nerved, 3.5 in. long, and .6 in. broad; the two smaller about 2 in. long, and .2 in. broad, about 3-nerved.
