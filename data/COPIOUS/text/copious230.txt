128 G. King â€” Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. [No. 2, Fruiting-calyx shorter than the fruit. Leaves 3.5 to 6 in. long: fruit -4 in. in diam. 1. R. pallidium. Leaves 7 to 10 in. long: fruit .65 in. in diam. 2. R. Scortechinii. Fruiting-calyx longer than the fruit ... 3. R. Kunstleri. 1. Retinodendron pallidium, King. A small tree (fide Dyer): young branches slender, deciduously puberulous, their bark pale. Leaves coriaceous, oblong-lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, acuminate; the edges entire, recurved when dry; the base acute: both surfaces glabrous, the upper shining; main nerves 9 to 10 pairs, curving, oblique; length 3.5 to 6 in., breadth 12 to 1.8 in., petiole .4 to .5 in. Panicles axillary, rarely extra-axillary, puberulous, I to 3 in. long. Flowers .45 in. long; Calyx-segments ovate-lanceolate, scurfy-pubescent. Petals oblong, lanceo-late, sub-acute, stellate-pubescent externally. Anthers broadly ovate, with a short blunt apiculus. Ovary puberulous; stigma capitate, lobed. Fruit globular, about .4 in. in diam., glabrous, shining, very minutely and sparsely lepidote, partially covered in the lower half by the slightly unequal, spreading or sub-reflexed, narrowly-oblong, membranous, 3-nerved, reticulate calyx-lobes. Vatica pallida, Dyer in Hook. fil. Fl. Br. Ind. 1, 302. Penang: Maingay, on Government Hill, at an elevation of about 800 feet; Curtis, No. 117; King, Kunstler. This is known only from Penang. It is evidently a rare tree. Its fruit somewhat resembles (except in size) that of V. lancecefolia, Blume. 2. Retinodendron Scortechinii, King, n. sp. A tall tree: young branches rather stout, densely furfuraceous-pubescent. Leaves coria-ceous, oblong, tapering to the sub-acute apex; the base slightly nar-rowed, rounded: both surfaces glabrous: main nerves 14 to 18 pairs, spreading, curving, prominent on the lower, depressed on the upper, surface when dry, the transverse venation bold: length 7 to 10 in., breadth 2.6 to 32 in , petiole .6 to .75 in. Panicles crowded towards the apices of the branches, mostly axillary, 2 to 2.5 in. long, the rachises brownish flocculent stellate-tomentose, as is the calyx exter-nally. Flowers .6 in. long. Calyx-lobes ovate. Petals thick, oblong, blunt, puberulous externally, glabrous within. Stamens elliptic, apicu-late. Ovary minutely tomentose; stigma clavate. Ripe fruit sub-globular, sub-rugose, vertically grooved, minutely rufous-scurfy, about .65 in. in diam , laxly embraced in the lower half by the broadly ovate, membranous, many-nerved, reticulate, sub-equal calyx-lobes. Perak: Scortechini, Nos. 1940 and 1942. The calyx-lobes are nearly equal in size, quite free from the fruit, much shorter, and they embrace only its lower half. This species is allied to Retinodendron Rassalc, Korth. (Nat. Gesch. Ned. Ind. 56, t. 8,)
