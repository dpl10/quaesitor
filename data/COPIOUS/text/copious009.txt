12 2 Dipterocarpaceae. {Doona. Moist low country up to 2500 ft. or more ; rather common. Near Navalapitiya ; Ambagamuwa ; Singhe Raja Forest ; Morowak Korale (Capt. Walker) ; Pelmadulla (F. Lewis). Fl. April. Endemic. Easily recognised by the fine small raised reticulation of the upper surface of the leaf. The name 'Yakahalu' is applied, with different prefixes, to several other species of this family in South of Ceylon. This is called ' BeraliyaYakahalu ' in S. Prov. There appear to be several varieties recognised by the natives, and possibly more than one species are confounded here. The fruit of the Ambagamuwa tree (2200 ft.) is shorter and has smaller fruit-sep. than as above described. The fruits are dried, pounded, and made into flour for food, and are largely consumed when they can be got, but are said to be produced only every seventh year. It was abundant in the S. Prov. in 1887.

A large tree, bark smooth, coming off in large flakes, young parts slightly pubescent ; 1. 4-6 in., ovate or oblongoval, rounded or slightly subcordate at base, tapering to long caudate-acuminate apex, lat. veins about 10, often less, curved, conspicuous beneath only, petioles \^ m., fl. and ripe fruit not seen.
