An experiment was made with six fruits in order to see if submergence inhibited the splitting of the fruit wall : apparently it did not ; for all the six germinated in six days under water. The splitting is the work of the germinating young plant pushing itself free. Figures 12, of gaping. 13 and 14. Three empty fruits showing various degrees The petioles of the cotyledons elongate in germination so much as to attain 2-7 cm. pushing the radicle out to the soil before they free themselves from the fruit-wall. They possess abundant chlorophyll. Leaving Shorea Thiseltoni. attention will now be directed to Vatica Ridleyana, Brandis. This species grows wild in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. It flowered in January, 1921, and bore ripe fruits from near the end of the year into the first quarter of 1922; â€” flowering had lasted a couple of weeks, but fruit-fall lasted three months. The considerable weight of the fruits has already been remarked: it remains to call attention to the circumstance that their growth from flowering to maturity takes twice as long as that of the smaller and closely allied V. Wallichii. Figure 15. A seedling of Vatica Ridleyana in germination, the stalks of the cotyledons pushing the plantlet into the soil. The outer cotyledon is towards the observer; above it a little of the placental-cotyledon is visible. Figure 16, the placentar cotyledon from the surface in contact with the outer cotyledon. Figure 17, the outer cotyledon from outside All 1/2 nat. size. The placentar cotyledon is the larger and fills the lower part of the fruit-cavity to the exclusion of the outer cotyledon; but it shares equally the upper part of the cavity. The result is that its bulk is nearly twice that of the outer cotyledon. In Balanocar-Jour. Straits Branch
