MYSORE AND C00RG, 23 41 Shorea robusta, Gaertn. Fig-Bedd. Fl. Sylv. t. 4. The Sal or Saul tree of the tropical Himalaya. Cultivated in the Lal-Bagh, but not found in the State forests. Being, next to teak, the most valuable timber tree of India, its cultivation is desirable. Beddome remarks that seedlings are abundant in the Gumsoor forests. 42 Shorea Tumbuggaia, Roxb. Tig— Bedd. Fl. Sylv. t 5. Wight Ic. t. 27. An immense timber tree of the Cuddapah district, and possibly indigenous to the north-east boundary of Mysore. It should be searched for along the course of the North Pennar river. A kind of dammar is obtained from the trunk, and Beddome speaks well of the timber. Forest officials of the Kolar and Chitaldoorg districts should be on the look out for this tree. 43 Hopea parviflora, Bedd. Kan. Kiral boghi, Bogi, Tirpul, Tirpu. 'Fig.— Bedd. Fl. Sylv. t. 6. References. — Did. of Econ. Prod, of Fad.; Gamb. Man. Timb. A lofty tree of the evergreen sholas. On the plains of South Canara it is preferably used to build Hindu temples. Lovery writes, that in Shimoga the wood is prized for building carts and boats. Weight 62 — 63 lb. per cubic foot. Being so heavy and durable, Beddome thinks it is well suited for sleepers and gun-carriage work. For ornamental purposes this is a grand subject, but it is not likely to succeed on the plains under 2500 feet. It possesses the characteristic winged fruit of Diptero-carpeae, by which trees of that Order are easily distinguished.
