AUTOPSIES AT THE PHILIPPINE MEDICAL SCHOOL. 221
A summary of the findings in these cases brings out certain points, some of which at least are of particular interest. Some idea of the importance of tuberculosis as a cause of death in these Islands is shown by the number of cases in this series, 35 per cent, and an idea of the virulence of the disease when once established may be drawn by comparing these figures with the number of cases showing healed tuberculous foci, 6 per cent, and latent foci, 2 per cent. The disease as encountered here is a rapidly progressing one, and the amount of tissue destroyed and thrown out of function is marked.
The frequency of chronic degenerative change of the myocardium and of nephritis is more noticeable when compared with the relatively small number of cases of arterial degeneration. The number of ulcerations of the large bowel, 32 per cent, and scarring, 22 per cent, while large, is smaller than the percentage of cases found b) r Musgrave in his series of examinations.
A feature by no means the least interesting is the absence of syphilitic lesion in all but one case.
