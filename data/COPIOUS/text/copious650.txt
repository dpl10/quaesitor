M. Levaillant met with this bird near Swartedooren, and Kausssi, which are rapid rivers in the little Namaqua's Country; but it being at a season after they had bred, he can give no account of the eggs, or of the note; it is, however, certain, that in the five specimens which were obtained, no signs whatever appeared of their having sit on the eggs in a nest ; said to feed on insects, especially grasshoppers, caterpillars, and pupae of butterflies.
According to M. Brisson, it is found at Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands ; at first sight might be taken for a young European Cuckow.
