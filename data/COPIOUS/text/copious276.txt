INTRODUCTION.
Some time ago the polychaetous annelid collections made by the United States Bureau of Fisheries Steamer Albatross in the Philippines were sent me for description. As a result of a preliminary study the old species were identified and sent to the United States National Museum some two years ago. Two new species were also described, but since-pressure of other duties prevented my continuing the work the remainder of the collection was turned over to my assistant, Miss Ruth Hoagland, whose report follows this. A few old species which I had overlooked are included in her report. These two papers together, then, comprise the report on the polychaetous annelids of this expedition.
DESCRIPTION OF SPECIES.
Family SYLLIDAE. Genus AUTOLYTUS Grube.
AUTOLYTUS TRIANGULIFERA Grube.
Autolytus triangulifera GRUBE, 1878, p. 132, pi. 7, fig. 8.
The polybostricous stage was collected in considerable numbers at San Miguel Harbor, Ticao Island. Grube reported that his specimens were incomplete. One specimen in this collection had in the posterior region 31 somites similar in structure, though narrowing very noticeably toward the posterior end. These somites are largely covered by the prominent parapodia. Somites 32, 33, 34, 49, 50, and 51 of the entire body have small parapodia and are covered dorsally with a brownish pigment, an expansion of the median pigment spots occurring in the anterior somites. Behind somite 44 was a colorless region containing about six somites with very small pair580
