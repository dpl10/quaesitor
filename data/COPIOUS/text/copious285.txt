MELIACEAE.
Melia Family. Melia Azedarach, L.
Nom. Vulg. — Paralso Paradise), Sp-fil; Pride of India, China Tree, Eng.
Uses. — The root was official in the U. S. P, 1880, as an anthelmintic ; it is administered in the following form
Fresh root bark 120 grams.
Water 1 liter.
Boil till reduced one half.
Dose. — For a child 1 soup-spoonful every 15 minutes till nausea is produced.
In view of the narcotic effects produced by this drug, the foregoing method of administration seems to us imprudent ; we prefer to give 30-70 grams of the decoction and follow with a purgative such as castor oil.
This drug is also tonic, febrifuge and astringent, and a decoction of its leaves and flowers is used as a wash for ulcers. Some believe that the leaves and fruit contain toxic principles, which may well be true considering the effects of large doses of their preparations. It has also been observed that the bark collected in March and April may cause dilatation of the pupil, stupor, etc; this may be explained by the fact that at this season the sap is rising in the tree and the bark contains an increased amount of active ingredients.
The fruit yields a fixed oil, and by fermentation and distillation produces alcohol.
