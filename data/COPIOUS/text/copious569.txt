PI. i. 119; Shorea siamensis, Miq. ; PL Brit. Ind. i. 304. Vern. Engyin, Burm. A large tree, heartwood brown, hard and durable, on dry ridges a shrub. Leafless during part of the hot season, when the tree is covered with large panicles of showy flowers. Leaves ovate, whitish-tomentose beneath while quite young. Fl. f in. across, petals orbicular, at flowering time forming a hollow globe, open at the top, enclosing stamens and ovary. Stamens 15, anthers oblong, cells equal, the valves of each cell, as well as the connective, prolonged into a shortawn, so that each anther has 5 subulate appendages. Ovary glabrous, prolonged in to a conical stylopodium, style filiform, glabrous. All calyx segments enlarged in fruit, but the three outer much larger than the others, all narrowed into a stalk, which expands into a broad base, appressed to the base of fruit, but not enclosing it. Cotyledons thick, fleshy, stipitate, concave, enclosing each other, filled with fat and oil, radicle short, plumula conspicuous. Throughout the Eastern Peninsula, extending to 25° N. Lat.

Flowers as a rule in unilateral spikes or racemes, which are distichous and regularly alternating on the branches of large axillary and terminal panicles. Each flower subtended by 2 bracteoles, mostly deciduous, in a few species persistent and conspicuous, Sepals strongly imbricate, hairy. Petals hairy outside. Anther cells generally equal ; connective as a rule prolonged into a pointed appendage. Segments of fruiting calyx with their broad bases
