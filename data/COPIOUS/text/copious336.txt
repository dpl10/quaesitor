HOPEA PARVIFLORA. (Nat. ord. Dipteroearpeae.) HOPEA (Roxb.) Gen. PI p. 193.— GEN. CHAR. Calyx tube very short aduate to the torus not increasing in fruit, divisions short obtuse often membranceous on the margin imbricate, 2 enlarging in fruit large and wing-like erect, the rest small, all connivent over the fruit at the base. Stamens 15 rarely 10, anthers ovate, conneetivum subulato-cuspidate, cells obtuse equal valved. Ovary 3 celled, cell 2 ovuled, style short terete or subulate. Fruit indehiscent, 1 seeded, seed ovoid, cotyledons thick fleshy unequal. Trees yielding resin, glabrous or tomentose, stipules small deciduous, or inconspicuous, leaves entire coriaceous — a genus nearly allied to Shorea. HOPEA PARVIFLORA. (Bedd.) Petioles panicles and calyx hairy, leaves short petioled glabrous ovate to oblong furnished with glands in the axils of the veins beneath, 2 to 2 1/2 inches long by 1 to 1 1/2 broad, flowers secund subsessile numerous very minute, sweet scented, stamens 15 alternately single and in pairs, stigma 3 cleft. A large handsome tree, common in both the moist and dry forests in Malabar and South Canara, up to an elevation of 3,500 feet. The wood is hardly known commercially as yet, but it is much valued by the Natives in South Canara, and I believe it will be of great value for gun carriage purposes, and I have forwarded specimens to Madras and Bombay — it will also answer well for sleepers. In Malabar it is called Irubogam and in South Canara Kiral Boghi on the ghats and Tirpu in the plains ; in the latter district it is much valued for temple building purposes.
