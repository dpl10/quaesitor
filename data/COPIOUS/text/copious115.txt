San Luis Obispo County, and eradication efforts undertaken as necessary.
The potential is great for harm by R. clecollata to the unique, endemic land snail fauna of San Nicolas Island. Among the strictly endemic native snails, Micrarionta opuntia Roth 1975, never attains a shell diameter of more than about 103 mm; the mean adult shell diameter of Micrarionta feralis (Hemphill, 1901) is around 15 mm (Pearce, 1990; Roth, 1996). For these species, the "refuge" of a size greater than 15 mm diameter (which allows Helix aspersa to persist at low numbers in the presence of R. decouata) is unavailable. In addition, the total known range of M. feralis covers only a few hundred square meters.
The San Nicolas Island species Xerorionta tryoni (Newcomb, 1864) attains an adult shell diameter of 1928 mm. Size-frequency distribution of a population observed in 1981 suggests that maximum shell size and sexual maturity are attained late in the second or early in the third year of life. A shell diameter of 15 mm is probably not attained until the second year of life (BR, unpublished observations). Time to maturity in Helix aspersa varies, but in a coastal southern California setting with artificially applied water, snails matured in 6-8 months (Potts, 1975). Under laboratory conditions, a shell diameter of 15 mm was attained in about 25-45 days (Potts, 1975: fig. 2). Juvenile Xerorionta tryoni spend more time in the vulnerable  15-mm size class than do juvenile Helix aspersa, and therefore the potential impact of predation upon populations of X tions is greater than that recorded for H. aspersa.
The apparent localization and slow spread of Rumina decollata on San Nicolas Island suggest that its eradication on that island may be possible.

The Occurrence of the Shell-less Neritacean Gastropod Titiscania limacina in the Galapagos Islands

Only two species of shell-less neritacean gastropods of the family Titiscanidae have been described: Titiscania limacina Bergh, 1875, and T. shinkishihataii Taki, 1955. The former was discovered and drawn by Carl Semper during his voyage to the Philippines, and it was first named by Bergh (1875: pi. 41, fig. 10) based on Semper's figure. Later. Bergh (1890) published a complete descrip- tion based on additional specimens from Mauritius. This species has been also recorded in the Eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama (Marcus & Marcus, 1967; Houston, 1990; personal observation); in the Eniwetok Atoll (Marcus & Marcus, 1967); in north-
