DIPTEROCARPE.E 85 the pores. The wood resembles that of Meliacece, or of Pentace in Tiliacece. Assam valley and surrounding hills, up to 2000 ft. ; Cachar, Chittagong and Burma. Brandis says this is " a large shrub, sometimes growing into a tree." S. E. Peal says that the wood is pleasant to work, makes good planking and excellent charcoal. If this is Skinner's No. 131 (Vateria lancecefolia, Roxb.; Vern. Let-touk, Burm.), the weight is 58 lbs. and P = 931 ; Wallich gives 54 lbs., the specimen 35 lbs. Kurz says that the tree gives a strong-smelling balsam, the Ghtlnd of the Brahmins. lbs. B 2508. Burma (Brandis, 1862) 35 Tribe IV. VATERIEjE. 11. STEMONOPORUS, Thw. A genus of endemic Ceylon trees, 15 in number, all more or less scarce. It is made a section of Vateria in the Fl. Br. Ind. 8. Wightii, Thw. ; Trimen PI. Ceyl. i. 132 ( Vateria ceyianica, Wight ; Fl. Br. Ind. i. 314) ; Vern. Halmendora, Cingh., a large tree of the moist low country, is the principal species. 12. MONOPORANDRA, Thw. Another endemic Ceylon genus containing two rather scarce trees, M. cordifolia, Thw. and Ji. elegans, Thw.; Trimen Fl. Ceyl. i. 137, 138. 13. VATERIA, Linn. Two species. V. acuminata, Heyne ; Fl. Br. Ind. i. 313 ; Trimen Fl. Ceyl. i. 131 (F. indica, L. ; Bedd. Fl. Sylv. xxvii.) ; Vern. Hal, Cingh., is a beautiful tree of the moist low country of Ceylon, giving a light, rather hard, yellowish-grey wood, weighing 40 to 42 lbs. per cubic foot (F. Lewis), and a clear yellowish resin, said to be equal to the best dammar. 1. V. indiea, Linn. ; Fl. Br. Ind. i. 313 ; Roxb. Fl. Ind. ii. 602 ; Talbot Bomb. List. 18. V. malabarica, Blume ; Bedd. Fl.

Piney maram, dhup maram, vallay kungiliam, kondricam, Tam. ; Dupa maram, dhupa, paini, munda dhup, illupathla, gugle, Kan.; Dupada, Tel.; Payani, paini mara, per urn piney, vella koudrihun, Mai.; Hal, Cingh. A large evergreen tree. Bark whitish-grey, rough, g in. thick, peeling off in round thick flakes. Sapwood white with a tinge of grey or red ; heartwood light grey, rough, moderately hard, porous. Pores large, often subdivided, ringed. Medullary rays fine and broad, very prominent on all vertical sections, while on a radial section they appear as rough plates with white shining fibres between them. The distance between the broad rays is generally greater than the transverse diameter of the pores. Annual rings doubtful, though distinct. Evergreen forests at the foot of the Western Ghats from Kanara to Travancoiv, ascending to 4000 ft. ; often planted as an avenue tree. Of this tree Beddome says, " It is one of the handsomest trees in the Madras ' Presidency ; it is common in all the western forests from the plaius up to 4000 ft., 'and is extensively planted as an avenue tree, particularly near the coast in South 1 Kanara, Malabar and Travancore; the avenue of it at Karkul in S. Kanara is 'a beautiful sight. It flowers in January." The wood is not much in request; it is occasionally used for canoes, for coffins, and the masts of native vessels. Mendis says that it is a "first-class timber for tea-chests, packing-cases, ceilings, coffins, etc.," but his wood specimeu does not look as if it were so good. Bourdillon gives weight -it'> lbs. P = 415 ; the specimens give 40 lbs. It -ives the piney gum resin, which makes an excellent varnish resembling copal. A full account of this, by Mr. Rroughton, Government Quinologist, is given in Bedd.
