Brandis (l. c. 118) characterizes the genus as follows: "Leaves as a rule coriaceous, petioles generally pubescent. Stipules mostly small, caducous. Secondary nerves distinct and limited in number, tertiary mostly reticulate. Flowers in spikes or racemes, not unilateral, arranged in terminal and axillary panicles. In some species there is what appears to be a cyme. The axis bifurcates, and there is an apparently terminal flower in the bifurcation. On closer examination it is found that what appears to be a terminal flower is the lowest lateral flower of the main axis or of the branch which has developed as strongly as the main axis. The calyx is valvate. Stamens 15, of which 10 are episepalous, standing in 5 pairs behind each other. Anthers short, glabrous ; cells very unequal, diverging at the base; appendix of connective obtuse, often very short, those of the 5 inner much longer. Ovary either free or half immersed in the obconical receptacle, often pitted, generally hairy; style cylindric, often ribbed and furrowed, mostly shorter than ovary; stigma capitate or conical. Segments of fruiting calyx either equal, shorter than fruit, or
