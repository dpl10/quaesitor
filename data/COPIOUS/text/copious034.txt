A tree about 7 m high, glabrous except the inflorescence. Branches terete, lenticellate, grayish or reddish-brown. Leaves alternate, odd-pinnate, the petiole and rachis 10 to 12 cm long; leaflets usually 7, subcoriaceous, ovate to oblong-ovate, up to 13 cm long and 45 cm wide, the apex shortly and obtusely acuminate, the base usually rounded, equilateral or somewhat inequilateral, the upper surface brownish-olivaceous when dry, shining, the lower paler; lateral nerves about 9 on each side of the midrib, prominent; petiolules 5 to 8 mm long. Flowers not known, the persistent rachises of the racemes axillary, solitary, thickened, somewhat pubescent, with numerous thickened protuberances. Pods brown when dry, oblong-elliptic, 1-seeded, woody, about 6 cm long, 3 cm wide, and at least 1 cm thick, narrowed below to the acute base and above to the rostrate-acuminate apex, glabrous, the corners rounded, not angled, the valves woody, shining, smooth. Seed solitary, subelliptic, somewhat narrowed to the rounded ends, about 35 cm long, 23 wn wide, and nearly 1 cm thick.

CROTALARIA Linnaeus
CROTALARIA ORIXENSIS Willd in Ges. Naturf. Fr. Neue Schr. 4 (1803) 217; Baker in Hook. f. Fl. Brit. Ind. 2 (1876) 83.
Luzon, Manila, Bur. Sci. 191 s Guerrero, December, 1912, in waste places, certainly of recent introduction.
For the identification of the above specimen I am indebted to Sit D. Prain, director of the Royal Gardens, Kew, England, to whom a specimen was sent. The species is of wide distribution in British India (Western Peninsula), in Abyssinia, and is reported from tropical Africa. It is undoubtedly a recent introduction in the Philippines.
