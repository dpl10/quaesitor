Cerithium torresi.
(Plate V. fig. 0)
Shell elongate-pyramidal, white, blackish towards the apex, ornamented with transverse series of dark-brown dots upon the first between the longitudinal granose costae.
Whorls 11, very slightly convex, separated by a deepish suture, costate and transversely Urate, the points of intersection of the ribs and ridges being developed into prominent white nodules.
The spiral Urae which become nodulous are three in number in the upper whorls, the uppermost being situated close to the suture, the next a little above the middle, and the lowermost below it, but more remote from the suture than the uppermost.
In addition, there are one or more simple thread-like lines revolving between the granules ridges, which are also articulated with brown.
The body-whorl has about eight principal transverse ridges, of which the three uppermost are the thickest, the two next rather finer and also granules, the three remaining ones being still more slender and more feebly nodulous.
The longitudinal ribs are about twelve on a whorl, one of them being swollen or varicose.
The last varix on the body-whorl is situated on the left of the aperture ; this is small, obliquely oval, terminating anteriorly in a short, oblique, and very slightly recurved canal.
The columella is considerably arched, white, covered with a thin callosity, developed at the upper part into an elongate ridge which runs within the aperture.
Labrum varixed externally, also thickened a little within and shallowly grooved, the grooves corresponding with the external ridges.
Length 14J millim, diam.
5 ; aperture 4| long and 2 wide.

The above-named and so-called species I believe to be mere variations of one and the same shell.
Compare the extreme forms ( C. macrostoma and O. pygmy), and one perceives a vast difference in outline and the number of whorls ; but even here several features in common wiu be found, namely the spotted expanded outer lip,
