Trees 30 to 40 m high, the' younger branchlets densely covered with brush-like, fascicled, tawny, stiff hairs; stipules rose-colored, up to 15 cm long, brushy-hirsute ; leaves of younger branchlets very large, 30 fo 45 cm long and of a thinner texture, the older ones smaller, broadly oblong to ovate-oblong, obtuse or rounded at the somewhat narrowed base, on a 5 cm brushy-hirsute petiole, shortly acuminate, chartaceous, or almost coriaceous, upper surface along the impressed nerves and lower surface everywhere pubescent with short, tawny, stellate and simple hairs. Flowers showy, rose-colored, forming simple, short, axillary racemes covered with brush-like, fascicled, stiff hairs; calyx tawny-tomentose with stellate hairs ; petals oblong, blunt, several times the length of the calyx, thickly covered on their outer surface with stellate hairs; fruiting calyx ovoid, about 2.5 cm in diameter, terete, the two wing-like lobes 17 to 20 cm long, 3 to 4 cm broad, with three prominent longitudinal vems and numerous, more or less distinct, transverse veins. Fruit hard and heavy, more or less fibrous inside, and containing resin; upper portion of the fruit with or without .small obtuse, rounded protuberances, which alternate with the lobes of the calyx. Dipterocarpus warburgii Brandis and D. lasiopodus Perk were de-scribed as belonging in the Section Tuberculati, but they were described from fragmentally or immature material, which does not present very conclusive evidence of their belonging to that section. Leaf and fruit characters of D. pilosus, as shown by our collections, have shown such a range of variability that it has seemed to me best to refer the above names to synonymy. It is possible that more complete material may show them to be good species, but at present I can see no reason for keeping them distinct.
