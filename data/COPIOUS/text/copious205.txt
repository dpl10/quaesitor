PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 263 12028 Merritt. Mindanao, District of Zamboanga, For, Bur. 6565, 9496 Hutchin-son, For. Bur. 9040, 9289 Whitford & Hutchinson. Basilan, For. Bur. 12369 Hutchinson. Many of our specimens are fragmentary and it is quite possible that there may be more than one species in the material cited above. The following numbers seem to belong to what Whitford 12 calls black yacal. The chief apparent difference in herbarium material seems to be that the leaves are a little broader and, perhaps, more inclined to be coriaceous. In drying, the leaves turn very dark and are more or less covered above with a glaucescence. Luzon, Province of Pangasinan, For. Bur, 19445 Agama: Province of Zam-bales, For. Bur. 13201, 13202 Cortes. Mindanao, District of Zamboanga, For. Bur. 9004 Whitford & Hutchinson. This species produces a resin or gum dammar, which is sometimes collected by the natives and used for torches. The flowering time of this species is not understood. Blanco, l. c, says that it flowers only in the month of March. In some sections, the people tlaim that it flowers only once in five or seven years. Native names: yacal (Tag.), saplongan (Tag.), siggay (Cag.), betic (11.), guisoc (B., V., Moro), taggai (II.)-5. Hopea sp. "Naric." Leaves narrowly oblong, 5 to 10 cm long, I6 to 26 mm wide, apex long-caudate-acuminate, base rounded, secondary nerves 10 to 12 pairs, with domatia in. their axils. Petiole 3 to 5 mm long. Stipules, early deciduous. Luzon, Province of Cagayan. For. Bur. 6497, 13414 Klemme. The following two numbers probably do not belong here; but, I do not know where else to place them. Luzon, Province of Bataan, For. Bur. 589 Barnes, Mar. 1904. Mindanao, District of Zamboanga, For. Bur. 9404 Whitford & Hutchinson, Feb. 1908. 6. Hopea sp. "Gyam." This large tree seems to be the same as that which occurs under the same name in the eastern part of British North Borneo. The bark is thin and brownish. The wood is a very heavy and very hard yacal. A tree of rather gregarious habit, growing on low flat lands near the coast. The leaves are elliptic or elliptic-lanceolate or narrowly oblong, 3 to 6 cm long and 1.5 to 2 cm wide, apex bluntly caudate-acuminate, base cuneate; secondary nerves 5 to 7 pairs, with very large domatia in their axils on the under side. Perhaps the most distinct species which we have in the genus. A single sterile specimen from Tawi Tawi, For. Bur,: 13380, collected by W. Schuck, June, 1910. 7. Hopea ovalifolia Boerl. in Cat. Hort. Bot. Bog. 1 (1899) 102. The description of this species is very meager and is from sterile material ; but we have a sheet from the garden at Buitenzorg, determined by Dr. Boerlage as this species and it seems to correspond quite closely to a collection of ours, also sterile.
