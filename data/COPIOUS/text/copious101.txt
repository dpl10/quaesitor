The flowers and young fruit show a five-ridged calyx. As the fruit matures, the hollows fill out and the fruit becomes more nearly spherical till finally the only remaining trace of the ridges is found in small, rounded protuberances, on the upper part of the fruit, alternating with the calyx lobes. The common native name for this species is hagachac. It is commonly found in those regions which have a comparatively even rainfall. It occurs on flat lands and low hills. It is gregarious in habit and frequently makes up the greater part of the stand where it occurs. Distribution: damp forests in the upper part of the Assam valley; Chittagong hills; Arracan; lower Pegu, hills between the rivers Sitang and Salween; Andaman Islands; Sumatra; Bangka; the Philippines. 2. Dipterocarpus affinis Brandis Journ. Linn. Soo. Bot. 31 (1895) 31. Plate XXXV. ' ' Branches and petioles stellate-tomentose. Leaves submembranaceous, oblanceolate, repand, blade 27 to 33 cm long; petioles 6 to 7 em. Secondary nerves 24 to 28 pairs, straight^, bent near margin and terminat-ing in reticulate intra-marginal veins. Tertiary nerves parallel and reticulate. Stipules linear, tomentose, twice as long as the petioles. Flowers large, short-pedicellate. Calyx-tube thickly coriaceous, tur-binate, smooth and glabrous, the lobes 2 linear, 3 short, reflexed. Ovary, stylopodium, and lower part of style pilose. Pubescence the same as that of D. pilosus, Braudis says that the difference between the two species consists in the narrow membranaceous leaves and the glabrous calyx of D. affinis^ the smaller segments in flower reflexed, and not erect. A number of specimens in our herbarium seem to fit this description and have fruit with them, which shows the short calyx wings slightly reflexed, but in no case is the fruit collected with the herbarium material actually attached to it, the fruits seeming to have been picked up h'on^ the ground. This leaves the suspicion that the membranaceous texture of the leaves may be due to their being young or seedling leaves, possibly immature forms of D. pilosus. The differences in the reflexed or erect calyx lobes are also very slight and might conceiveably he fortuitous or due to drying. I have checked Brandis' observation of the very close resemblance an possible identity of D. elongatus Korth. and D. affinis, and think it ;
