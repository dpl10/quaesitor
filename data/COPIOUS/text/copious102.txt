Limulus polyphemus
T. tridentatus has been reported from western and southern Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, North Borneo, Vietnam and Sumatra, Indonesia (15,33).
T. gigas and C. rotundicauda have been reported from the coast of India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Borneo and have essentially the same ranges (15,33).
All three Asian species are found sympatrically at Kota Kinabalu on the north-west coast of Borneo and throughout much of Indonesia and T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda are found sympatrically along the south-west coast of the Philippines including Palawan (33,3f).
POPULATION In general horseshoe crabs are abundant in the areas where they occur. In 1956 there were thought to be more than one hundred thousand adults in the Cape Cod Bay area (30) and currently L. polyphemus is often brought up in trawls and dredges off the east coast of the U.S.A. (32). The population in waters off Massachusetts, north of Cape Ann, is also probably large as 16to crabs have been tagged there (32). The largest of the populations along the east coast of the U.S.A. is centred on Delaware Bay (13,32); in 1977 and 1979 peak spawning activity was estimated to involve 305 500 adult animals (13). In coastal waters off New Jersey, crabs are abundant in the inshore 3 miles (5 km) from Cape May to Atlantic City, but much less common further north (14).
HABITAT AND ECOLOGY Horseshoe crabs are marine bottom dwellers living in sandy and muddy bays and estuaries. Limulus polyphemus has been well studied and most of this account deals with this species. In Florida, Gulf of Mexico, adults are found to a depth of 30 m, but major concentrations are found at about 5-6 m, and the animals only return to the beach to breed (25,31). Limuli have been dredged from depths to 2t6 m and at distances as far as 56 km off the Atlantic coast (26,32). C. rotundicauda differs from the other species in that it is often
