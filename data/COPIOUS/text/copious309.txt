1893.] Gr. King — Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. 105 wise glabrous. Stamens obtusely apiculate. Ovary depressed, minutely tomentose; stigma capitate. Fruit (not quite ripe) globular, umbonate, attached for half its length to the calyx. The two larger calyx-wings ob-lanceolate-oblong, obtuse or sub-acute, 5-nerved, flocculent-puberu-lous near the base when young, ultimately glabrous, 2 in. long and .5 in. wide ; the 3 smaller wings lanceolate, obtuse, .5 in. long. Langani: Curtis, Nos. 2797 and 2798. Kedah: Curtis, Nos. 2096 and 2514. When dried, the leaves of this are of a dull gray colour—hence the specific name. Its fruit resembles that of the next species, but the leaves have fewer and less prominent nerves. 6. Vatica Curtisii, King, n. sp. A tree about 40 feet high: young branches, petioles, inflorescense and calyx brownish scurfy-pubescent, ultimately glabrous. Leaves ovate-oblong, sub-acute, the base rounded, both surfaces quite glabrous, reticulate ; main nerves 11 to 13 pairs, blique, rather prominent beneath ; length 3 to 5 in., breadth 1.3 to 2.5 in., petiole .3 to -45 in. Racemes axillary, few-flowered, 1 to l.25 in. long. Flowers .35 in. long. Calyx-lobes unequal, the 2 longer narrowly oblong, obtuse ; the 3 shorter lanceolate-acuminate. Petals elliptic, slightly oblique, blunt, glabrous except the pubescent edge which is external in the bud. Ripe fruit globular, .3 in. in diam., adherent to the calyx for half its length, the larger calyx-lobes oblong-obovate, usually obtuse, rarely sub-acute, 5-nerved, 1.75 to 2 in. long, and .7 in. broad ; the smaller wings about .4 in. long. Penang: Curtis, No. 1579. 7. Vatica faginea, Dyer in Hook. fil. Fl. Br. Ind., I., 301. A tree 80 to 100 feet high: young branches slender, minutely cinereous stellate-tomentose as is the inflorescence. Leaves coriaceous, oblong or elliptic-oblong, finely reticulate, glabrous ; main nerves 9 to 11 pairs, spreading, curving, thin but prominent when dry ; length 4 to 5 in., breadth 1.5 to 2 in. Panicles 2 -5 in. long; flowers .5 in. long. Calyx-tube ribbed, minutely scurfy tomentose, the lobes unequal. Petals narrowly oblong, blunt, glabrous except the pubescent outside edge. Ovary hemispheric, minutely tomentose ; stigma capitate, lobed. Ripe fruit globular, adherent for half its length to the calyx, about .25 in. in diam., the style persistent ; the 2 larger calyx-wings narrowly oblong, or oblong-oblanceolate, obtuse, obscurely 5-nerved, 2 to 2.5 in. long, and .5 to .7 in. broad near the apex ; the three smaller wings un-equal, sub-spathulate, less than -5 in. long.
