DOONA ZEYLANICA. (Thw.) A lofty tree, trunk straight, much branched towards the upper part, bark rough and cracked, branches terete and smooth, leaves penniveined with numerous intermediate reticulations lanceolate dark-green above, paler beneath, rounded at the base, tapering towards the apex into a rather long acumination with an abrupt point, 2-2 1/4 inches long by 3/4 of an inch wide, petioles 1/2 inch long grooved along the upper surface, panicles furnished with small brown deciduous bractes, calyx pale-green tinged with red, the 3 enlarged leaves becoming a deeper red, petals pale rose darker at the tips, filaments united about 1/2 way up. Thw. I. c.  This is the famous Doon tree of Ceylon, called also shingle tree by the planters ; it is very abundant in the Central Provinces of that island up to 4,000 feet elevation, and the timber is highly prized for building purposes and for shingles; the tree yields a large quantity of colorless gum-resin from its trunk and branches, which when dissolved in spirits of wine or turpentine makes an excellent varnish. 07
