TRITONS TRUMPET or GIANT TRITON Charonia tritonis (Linnaeus, 1758) Phylum MOLLUSCA Class GASTROPODA
RARE
Order MESOGASTROPODA
Family CYMATIIDAE
SUMMARY Charonia tritonis has a large attractive shell which is popular with shell collectors and has had a long history of use in the Indo-pacific as a trumpet. It is found on coral reefs and appears to be rare throughout much of its range. In some places this may be a result of overcouection.
DESCRIPTION Charonia tritonis has a large, very attractive shell reaching 40 cm or more in length. It has a high pointed spire, and is creamy white with purple and brown markings and an orange interior to the aperture (1).
mm DISTRIBUTION Indo-west Pacific (1) to the Red Sea (19), including the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (t), the Philippines (6), Indonesia, Seychelles, Mozambique (22), Guam (lj), the Marshall Islands, Hawaii (23) and Fiji.
POPULATION Unknown, but densities appear to be naturally low in many areas. In a three month study in part of the Sudanese Red Sea only two specimens were found; over the same period local shell collectors had taken five and they reported that specimens were only found occasionally (19). Reported to be uncommon in Guam (If) and on the Great Barrier Reef where in a study of 81 reefs, only 2f specimens were found (20). In a survey of 133 sites on 92 reefs in Indonesia only two specimens were recorded (22). Population densities may actually be higher as specimens are difficult to find on account of their nocturnal habits and camouflaged shell (19).
