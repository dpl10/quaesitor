V Notes on Dipterocarps. 1. The Seedling of Anisoptera costata, Korth By I. H. Burkill. Pig. 1. Flower seen from below, x 2 1/4. It is proposed to clear the way for a general review of the Malayan Dipterocarps by a series of short papers, of which this is the first. It deals with the seedling of Anisoptera costata, Korthals. Anisoptera costata is a tall forest tree wild in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, where two individuals flowered freely at the commencement of April, 1916, producing with new foliage, panicles of pendent white flowers from the ends of the branches. The shape of the flower is given above (fig. 1) : the corolla does not fall. The seeds from this flowering ripened about the end of June : and when they fell, a leaf-fall occurred, followed by a more abundant production of new leaves than had been the case when the flowers appeared. The seeds germinated at once, lying on the ground. In germination the radicle is extruded, curves earthwards, and anchors itself; then the cotyledons are pulled out of the capsule by the straightening of the hypocotyl. The process is seen in progress in Figs. 2 and 5 below. Jour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc, No. 75, 1917.
