276 NOTES ON DIPTEKOCARPS. low and level ground, and the fruits were stranded in lines at the limit of the flooding. The duration of the floating was tested and described in a note by one of us (Journ. Straits Branch Eoy. As. Soc. 81, 1920, p. 75) where the wrong generic name Pachynocarpus was used for it. The average duration of floating in that experiment was found to be 2'2 days. The germination was described in the same place. The capsule is ruptured along three lines predetermined by weaknesses in the walls. These three lines are more -clearly shown in the capsule of the related Vatica Zollingeriana, A. DC., which is figured here, because it is instructive in regard to the nature of the less clearly marked lines of rupture in Vatica Wallichii. i Fig. 7. Shell of the fruit of Vatica Zollingeriana, A.DC, in vertical section showing the sepals (s), and the wall cut on one side down one of the lines of rupture, and on the other through the thick swollen mid-part between. Doubtless V. Zollingeriana is water-distributed, for the swollen part is such as would keep it floating. The fruiting calyx of V. Wallichii is developed to a somewhat variable extent : sometimes it is humped as in the first figure above; sometimes it is rather flat, as in the second. The two figures were from fruits picked from the ground of the Tasek Gelugor Forest Reserve at the same spot, and appeared to be the product of a tree immediately above them. Our material of Vatica Wallichii is as follows : â€” Province Wellesley. In the Tasek Gelugor Forest Reserve, with fruit, in September 1921, Burkill 6-599! Penang.
