NOTES ON DIPTEROCARPS. 167 Fig. 17 Figs. 14, 15, 16, 17. Abnormal seedlings of Shores macroptera. The period from flowering to seed fall in the Shoreas, all except S. bracteolata being wild in the Botanic gardens, is about ten weeks in the case of S. leprosula, S. rigida, S. macroptera and S. pauciflora) about nine weeks in the case of S. bracteolata and S. gibbosa. S. gratissima, Dyer, which in addition to those just named also occurs wild in the Botanic gardens, flowered in 1915 in three trees, at some little distance from each other, one being in area N. (No. 1239) the second in area U (No. 1237), and the third in area V (No. 1238) ; and it did not flower along with all the other species in 1916. But apparently it has flowered on earlier occasions at the same time as other species, and probably the conditions which lead to the flowering of all are very similar. One tree of S. leprosula which had not flowered in 1916, a young tree, flowered in 1917: clearing had been done round it in 1916 and it had received some injury during the work. There was consequently in its case a change of conditions which might account for the flowering. In the case of all the species, such records as exist in the Singapore herbarium suggest that flowering occurs in the first suitable season after three years have elapsed from the last heavy seed-crop. In India S. robusta flowers in almost every year, but on the average one year in three only is a year of good seed. R. A. Sac, No, 76. 1917.
