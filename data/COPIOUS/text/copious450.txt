1893.] G. King — Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. 123 half of the fruit, the apices of some of them being winged as above described. In these respects the species resembles certain other Malayan species of Shorea, e. g., S. Martiniana Scheff, S. scaberrima, and S. stenoptera, Bnrck. Judging from the leaf-specimens on which Miquel foivnded his Hopea singkawang, that plant must be a close ally of this. A species (flower only) collected by H. O. Forbes in Sumatra (Herb. No. 2952) must also be closely allied to this. It differs however by its conspicuously bracteolate inflorescence. Beccari's Nos. 2681 and 3507, which form the types of Heim's species S. brachyp-tera, are also allied to this. 6. Hopea, Roxb. Glabrous or hoary-tomentose resinous trees. Leaves quite entire, firm, feather-veined; stipules small, deciduous or inconspicuous. Flowers sessile or shortly pedicelled, ebracteate, in lax panicles of uni-lateral racemes. Sepals inserted on the receptacle, two being quite external and three for the most part internal, obtuse, imbricate. Petals falcate, their apices inflected in bud. 8tamens 15, or rarely 10, slightly connate; the connective subulate-cuspidate, the anthers ovate, their valves obtuse, equal. Ovary 3-celled, the cells 2-ovuled: style shortly cylindric or subulate. Fruit 1-seeded, closely surrounded by the bases of the accrescent sepals, the 2 external of which are developed into linear wings, the three internal not longer than the ripe fruit. Embryo as in Shorea. — Distrib. of Shorea; species about 35. Sect. I. Eu-hopea, Main nerves of leaves bold and prominent. Nerves of leaves 16 to 18 pairs; accrescent sepals 4 to 4.5 in. long, 10-nerved ... 1 H. nervosa. Nerves of leaves 10 to 13 pairs; accrescent sepals 1.75 to 2.5 in. long, obscurely 5-nerved 2. H. Curtisii. Sect. II. Dryobalanoidea, Miq. Main nerves not distinct. Petals sericeous: the filaments longer than the anthers; ripe fruit .3 in. long, the accrescent sepals 7-nerved, l.75 to 2 in. long, and .2 to .25 in. broad; leaf-petioles .25 to .4 in. long, minutely tomentose... ... ... 3. H. micrantha. Petals densely sericeous; the filaments shorter than the anthers; ripe fruit .2 in. long; ac-crescent sepals obscurely 5-to 7-nerved, 1.25 to 1.5 in. long, and .25 in. broad; leaf-petioles .35 to .6 in. long, slender, pubcrulous, finally glabrous ... ... ... 4. H. intermedia.
