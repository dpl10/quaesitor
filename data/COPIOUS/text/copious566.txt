The milky juice is neutral and coagulates rapidly, separating in two parts  a kind of insoluble pulp and a limpid colorless serum.
If combined with fibrin, raw meat, white of egg or gluten it gradually softens them and completely dissolves them in 3 or 4 hours in vitro at 40Â° C. Combined with milk it coagulates it and soon precipitates the casein which is also dissolved a little later.
It digests lumbricoids and tape-worms and the false membrane of croup, in a few hours.
According to Wurtz and Bouchut papain is prepared as follows
The fluid juice or the aqueous solution of the milky exudate is precipitated by the addition of ten times the volume of alcohol.
The precipitate, after treating again with concentrated alcohol, is dissolved in water and the addition of sub-acetate of lead eliminates the albuminoids and peptones but does not precipitate the japan.
The liquid is filtered and the lead salts separated by means of a current of hydrogen sulphide.
It is filtered again and alcohol added gradually, which process first precipitates whatever sulphate of lead may have passed through the filter, and then the papain.
Papain is an amorphous substance, perfectly white, soluble in water, insipid, odorless.
An aqueous solution, if shaken violently, foams like a solution of soap.
Boiling makes it turbid and when concentrated it has a slightly astringent taste.
It is precipitated by hydrochloric, nitric, picric and the meta-phosphoric acids.
Trommer's test gives it a beautiful blue violet color which, on boiling, changes to a red violet.
