18. SHOREA SCROBICULATA Burck. Luzon, Tayabas Province, For. Bur. 22712, July 30, 1914 This differs from the type of Shorea scrobiculata in having generally smaller leaves and fruits and in the longer and more slender wings to the fruits. Its general appearance is so like the species, however, that it is thought best to place it with S. scrobiculata, for the present. Credited with being a yacal. The species, till now, has been known only from Borneo.

A very large tree with thick black, furrowed or scaly bark Heartwood dark red, moderately hard and light. A fine grade of red lauan but harder and heavier than is usually the case with that wood. It has some resemblance to guijo and is locally known by that name. It grouws with other Dipterocarps in tall forest. The fruit, when fresh, showed a distinct reddish tinge in the wings, the nut being covered with a pale silky pubescence. The fruit is eaten by the forest animals very quickly after its fall.
