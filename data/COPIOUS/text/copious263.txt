1. Hopea Wightiana, Wall. Cat. (1828) 6205. A large tree; young branches pubescent, at length glabrous. Leaves 5-8 by 2-3 in., oblong or ovate-oblong, obtuse or subacute, glabrous, rounded at the base ; lateral nerves 7-10, oblique, curved ; petioles | in. long, velvety pubescent. Elowers secund, in axillary panicles, the panicles 1-6 together, slender, glabrous, shorter or rarely longer than the leaves ; bracts lanceolate, y .7-g in. long ; pedicels very short. Calyx glabrous ; lobes (when flowering) ovate, obtuse, the exterior larger. Petals pink, I in. long, oblong, acute, externally pubescent, ciliate. Filaments 10, dilated at the base, each alternate one carrying 2 anthers ; anthers ovate, each with a long filiform appendage about 4 times its length. Nuts 4 in. long, ovoid, apiculate, glabrous, surrounded by the accrescent calyx, 2 of the lobes of whicli are developed into long crimson wings 2-2| by l-f in., oblong-obovate, 7-9-nerved. Fl, B.

A globular, echinate excrescence, resembling the young fruit of the horse-chestnut, probably due to some insect, often deforms the inflorescence. Roxburgh described this deformation as Artocarpus lanceofolia (Fl. Ind. v. 3, p. 527). 

The figure k, in Engl. & Prantl, Pflanzenf. 1. c, which is taken from Wight, 111. t. 37, does not show the 2 anthers on the alternate filaments. These are well figured by Beddome, 1. c. — Flowers : Mar.-June.
