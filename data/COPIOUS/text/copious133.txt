PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 255 Fructus globosus 1 ad 1.5 cm diametro, tubo calycino apice valde con-stricto, calycis segmentis 2 majoribus oblanceolatis 5 ad 8 cm longis, 6 ad 10 mm latis, 3 minoribus linearibus 1-3-nei-viiP, scabris. The conspicuous thing about this species is the chocolate brown tomen-tose under surface of the leaves and the large globose fruits, which are also chocolate brown. The leaves are oblanceolate or elliptic, more or less blunt or rounded at apex and base, and the margins slightly inrolled. Secondary nerves 12 to 15 pairs with intermediate shorter nerves which join the reticulate tertiary ones. Secondary and some of the tertiary nerves more or less uniting to form intra-marginal veins. Petioles 2 to 4.5 cm long, rather slender, thickened in upper one-fourth of their length. Fruit globose, scurfy, dark-brown. The two long wings somewhat pubes-cent, with three or four principal nerves and numerous secondary' nerves which are transverse or oblique and reticulate. The three shorter wings linear, one-to three-nerved, somewhat scurfy like the fruit. Differs from A. curtisii in size, shape and color of fruit and in color of tomentum. The last feature makes it very distinct in appearance trom A. thurifera. We have this species, thus far, only from the province, of Cagayan and Ilocos Norte. The type was collected in the neighbhorhood of Camalamaiungan where it is said to grow in dense flat forest near sea level. LUZON, Province of Cagayan, For.

Large tree 25 to 35 m tall, young branches slender, minutely scurfy-tomentose. Leaves oblong, tapering to both ends, the apex subacute or acute, the base narrowed but rounded ; the upper surface glabrous, shining, the lower densely ochraceous-lepidote and sparsely stellate-pubescent length 5 to 8.75 cm, breadth 1.9 to 3.1 en,, petiole 1.25 to 1.9 cm long;secondary nerves 18 to 20 pairs, spreading; accrescent calyx lobes 8.75 to 11.25 cm long, linear-spatulate, 3-nerved, the transverse veins bold and numerous. The most noticeable feature of this species is the brilliantly yellow lower surface of the leaves, the color being due to the very numerous small round scales with which the under surface is colored. These scales are apparently of the same kind as those of A. brunnea, but here they impart a yellow color to the leaf. The freshly matured fruit has a pale greenish-yellow color. The bark of mature trees is fissured, grayish in
