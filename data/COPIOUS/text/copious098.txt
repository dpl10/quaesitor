The leaves are larger and more membranaceous and the tertiary veins much more prominent than is usually the case in A. thurifera. Our material for these two numbers is not sufficiently complete to warrant separating them from the common species at the present time. 

The field notes with our herbarium specimens seem to indicate that the tune of flowering for this species is during the months of April, May, and June and the time of fruiting during the months of January, February, March, April, !May, July, August, October, November, and December. Blanco, 1. c., states that this species flowers and fruits in the month of June, in the mountains of San Mateo. He also states that a hard whitish resin, which is used for incense in some of the churches, is obtained from this species. The correctness of this statement seems very doubtful, as we have not found this species to produce such a resin. There is also confusion regarding Blanco's use of common names for this species. He gives the names of lauan and sandana, which we have found to apply to other species. We have found the following native names used for this species: mayapis (Tag.); palosapis (Tag,); dagum (Tag.); dagang tia puft (Tag.); guyong or duyong (Hoc.) ; letis (Mas.). 

4. Anisoptera sp. This form is as nearly as possible intermediate between A. thurifera and A. curtisii. The habit of the tree and the appearance of many of the mature leaves is that of A. thurifera. The young leaves look like those of A. curtisii and the fruits also resemble those of that species. In some of the examples listed under A. thurifera, the fruit is small and it is difficult to tell whether it is really immature A. thurifera or this form. This form has been found in the provinces of Bataan and Zambales and is represented by the following: Province of Bataan, For. Bur. 1377, 1381, 1390, 1407 Borden, July 1904, with young fruit, For.
