LIST OF THREATENED INVERTEBRATES AND THREATENED COMMUNITIES ARRANGED BY COUNTRY AND ZOOGEOGRAPHICAL REGION
The zoogeographical regions first described by Wallace in 1876 are used, slightly modified, as a basis for this index. Boundaries have been adjusted in some cases in order to avoid subdividing a particular political unit.
The Palearctic region is the northerly part of the Old World. It extends over the whole of Europe, U.S.S.R. and China, including the adjacent offshore islands, and includes the Mediterranean coast of Africa. In the present list the entire Arabian Peninsula is assigned to this region.
The Ethiopian region covers central and southern Africa.
The Oriental region covers Asia south of China from the western border of Afghanistan and Pakistan east to the Pacific Ocean including the Philippines and Indonesia.
The Australasian region includes Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand.
The Nearctic region covers all of North America including Greenland, the Aleutian Islands and, in this volume, the whole of Mexico.
The Neotropical region includes the Caribbean Islands, Central and South America.
Oceanic islands have been placed in a separate section.
Non-marine species (including those from brackish water and lagoons) and threatened communities are arranged by country, marine species by broad oceanic region. Since most marine species in this book have wide distributions and records for some are incomplete, countries and islands within oceanic divisions are not given. Readers are referred to the individual accounts for details. Marine threatened communities are listed under the relevant country.
'Ex' following a taxon denotes that it is regarded as extinct in that country and '' denotes lack of confirmation of its presence.
