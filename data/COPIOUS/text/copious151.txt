354 Flora Malesiana [ser. I, vol. 9^2 Fig. 44. Fruiting twig of Vatica rassak (Korth.) Bl. near Sarmi, c. 200 km west of Hoilandia. Irian Jaya (Photogr. Karstel. Dec. 1957). 

doyong (Sula Is.), damar hiru, salo hiru, damar atung, geru (Moluccas). Notes. Another variable semi-gregarious chiefly riparian species (see e.g. V. umbonata). The above description defines my interpretation of this variable species. The large, oblong-elliptic, coriaceous leaves with long petiole, and the large, corky nut. are characteristic though the nut shape is very variable (in part owing to the degree of maturity on herbarium specimens). Its distribution into seasonal areas and its semi-gregarious ecology parallel that of other polymorphic species such as Anisoptera costata KORTH., A. thurifera (BLCO) BL., and Vatica umbonata (Hook. f.) BURCK. The variation is locally too great to clearly distinguish geographical subspecies. Some hybridisation appears to occur with V. umbonata in East Sabah.  11. Vatica granulata SLOOT. Bull. Jard.
