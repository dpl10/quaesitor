PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 271 

A translation of Blanco's original description for Mocanera malaanonan is as follows: Leaves ovate, lanceolate, broad, abruptly pointed, whitish beneath. Calyx divided almost to the base into five oblong parts, constricted a little above the fruit; the three exterior more than 7.5 cm long. Fruit oval, free at maturity, surrounded by the calyx, outer covering fragile, crowned with a long style, which bears three stigmas, and with a seed of three or four lobules in a compartment. Trees of some diameter, known at Angat by the rather equivocal name of malaanonang; the leaves have a length of a span, they are broad and the new ones are whitish and soft beneath. This distinguishes it sufficiently from other members of the genus. The tree also gives an odorous resin, but in small quantity. Vidal's description of S. polita evidently refers to a narrower form and is as follows : Leaves lanceolate-elliptic, acute at apex, rounded at base, the margin somewhat undulate; leaf blade 6 to 12 cm by 2 to 4 cm petiole 2 to 3 cm ;. lateral nerves 12 to 15 pairs, slightly ascending (about 60°) not very distinct, very smooth in the interspaces. Fruiting calyx of a brilliant gray, the part which envelops the nut very round, with three long, usually unequal (5 to 8 cm) wings and 2 short and narrow (3 cm) reddish-yellow which are much reticulated and with about 10 nerves It seems that a narrow-leaved and a broad-leaved form of malaanonang are recognized by the natives, but they seem to be connected by intermediate forms and it is for that reason that the two are here classed as one species. Closely resembling S. coriacea Burck but with larger and more nearly glabrous fruit. Perhaps the same species which was deseribed a S. hypocra by Hance from Cochinchina, but usually with a smaller number of secondary nerves. LUZON, Province of Cagayan, For.
