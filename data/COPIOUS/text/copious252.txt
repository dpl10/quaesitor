1893.] G. King â€” Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. 113 ed, about 4 times as long as the Ibroad short anthers; apiculus of con-nective very slender, about as long as the anther, deflexed. Ovary elongate, puberulous; style rather short; stigma small. Ripe fruit ovoid-globose, .4 in. long, thinly adpressed pale tomentose. Sepals all enlarged and membranous, concave at the base so as to embrace the ripe fruit, but not adnate to it: the three outer narrowly oblong, obtuse at the apex, slightly narrowed to the base; 7-nerved, 2.5 in. long; the two inner from one-half to one-third shorter, nar-rower and fewer nerved.

El. Br. Ind., I., 305. A tree 100 to 150 feet high; young branches minutely greyish tomentose, ultimately dark-coloured and glabrescent. Leaves coriaceous, ovate to lanceolate, acuminate, the base often unequal-sided, rounded or some-times emarginate; upper surface glabrous except the puberulous midrib; the flower glabrous, with a few scattered stellate hairs: main nerves 7 to 9 pairs, spreading, slightly prominent beneath: length 3 to 4.5 in , breadth 1.75 to 2.5 in.; petiole .3 to .4 in., tomentose. Panicles axillary and terminal, crowded near the extremities of the branches, 2 to 3 in. long, minutely stellate-pubescent, many-flowered. Flowers .3 in. long, distichous, secund, about 5 on each lateral branch, bracteolate. Sepals ovate, unequal, tomentose outside, glabrous inside. Petals twice as long as the calyx, spreading, broadly ovate, puberulous outside, glabrous inside. Stamens 15, in three rows, the inner row shorter: filaments broad, much larger than the short, ovate, minutely appendiculate anthers. Ovary ovoid, tapering, pubescent: style short, stigma small. Ripe fruit turbinate, with 3 slightly vertical grooves, apiculate, puberulous, -5 in. in diam., attached by its base to the calyx: sepals all enlarged, concave at the base so as completely to cover the fruit, membranous and reticulate; the 3 outer narrowly oblong obtuse, contracted towards the base, 10-or 11-nerved, 35 in. long, and 7 in. broad; the two inner 1 to 1.5 in. long, under .25 in. broad, 3-to 4-nerved.

A tree 60 to 80 feet high: young branches with dark-brown bark, minu-tely lenticellate and puberulous.
