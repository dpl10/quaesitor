Tenasserim, Mergui, on the summit of the hillock Pator, at 600-800 ft. elevation (Griff.). Griffithâ€™s description is a very complete and good one, but still I cannot guess the plant. The ovary-like style would indicate Anisoptera, but the ovary itself is stated to be superior and free. Malvaceae. Conspectus of genera. A. Carpels whorled in a single row, not united into a capsule. Trib. I. Malveae. Staminal column bearing the filaments at the summit. Style-branches as many as cells to the ovary. Mature carpels separating more or less from the axis. * Ovule solitary, ascending. X Stigmas linear. 1. Althaea. Bracteoles 6-9, united at base; fruit-axis not longer than the carpels. 2. Malva. Bracteoles 3, distinct. Carpels not beaked. XX Stigmas capitate or clavate. 3.Malvastrum. Bracteoles 1 to 3, distinct, or none. Carpels usually beaked. ** Ovules suspended, solitary. 4. Anoda. Bracteoles none. Carpels broadly stellate, not beaked. 5. Sida. Carpels converging with their points or beaked. Bracteoles none, or very rarely 1 or 2 and bristle-like. *** Ovules 2 or more, ascending or pendulous or both. 6. Abutilon. Bracteoles none. Carpels 5-20, without spurious partitions. Trib. II. Ureneae. Staminal column truncate or 5-toothed at apex bearing the anthers or filaments on the outside. Style-branches twice as many as ovary-cells. Carpels 1-seeded. 7. Urena. Bracteoles 5, connate at base. Carpels opposite the petals, muricate or glochidiate. 8. Pavonia. Bracteoles 5 or more, usually free, herbaceous or bristle-like.
