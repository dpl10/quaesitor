102 G King -Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. [No. 2, calyx unequally accrescent, two of them being much elongate, and the fruit being partly inferior; while the section Eu-Vatica, as proposed by Bentham and Hooker originally, and adopted by Burck, is characterised by having the same fruiting calyx as Synaptea; nothing being said about the adhesion between the calyx and the fruit. Pierre, on the other hand, keeps up Synaptea as a genus on account of the presence of albumen and the structure of the embryo (characters not easily worked in herbarium specimens of this family). In my own opinion it appears advisable to admit Synaptea as a section of Vatica, but to exclude Isauxis, Retinodendron, and Pachynocarpus, retaining these as distinct genera. Vatica would, according to this scheme, be divided into two sections:-I. Eu-Vatica:-Fruit free from accrescent calyx, i.e., fruit superior. II. Synaptea:-Fruit adnate in its lower part to the accrescent calyx, i.e., fruit half inferior. Sect. I. Eu-Vatica.-Fruit quite free from the calyx. Inflorescence and ripe fruit pale tomentose; flowers .4 in. long... ... ... 1. V. perakensis. Inflorescence and ripe fruit rusty-tomentose. Flowers .25 in. long; nerves of leaves 13 to 15 pairs; petioles .3 to .4 in. long... 2. V. Lowii. Flowers .45 in. long; nerves of leaves 9 to 12 pairs; petioles .6 to 1.5 in. long... 3. V. Maingayi. Sect. II. Synaptea-Calyx-wings dherent to the ripe fruit for nearly half its length. Leaves 9 to 19 in. long and with 18 to 20 pairs of nerves ... ... ... 4. V. nitida.

Leaves oblong or elliptic-oblong, with 9 to 11 pairs of nerves; petals narrowly oblong ... 7. V. faginea.
