about the size of a filbert, 5-sided, with 5 apartments each containing 5 ovoid seeds attached by separate seed stalks to the central axis of the ovary.
Seeds not woolly.

Gossypium herbaceum, L. (G. Indica, Lam; G. Capas, Rumph)
Nom.
Vulg.
— Algodon, Sp; Bulah, Tag; Cotton, Eng.
Uses.
— The root bark is antiasthmatic, emmenagogue, and according to Daruty 1 is a substitute for ergot in uterine hemorrhage.
The leaves are used in bronchial troubles and the seeds are sudorific.
The negroes in the United States use the root bark in large doses as an abortifacient ; but a dose of 60 grams to 1,200 of water in decoction is proper and useful in treating dysmenorrhea.
For a long time the seeds went to waste but industry has learned to obtain from them a brownish-red oil which is used as a substitute for olive oil, from which it is hard to distinguish it, if the latter is adulterated by mixing the two ; for both have the same density and a very similar odor and taste.
For this reason the production of cottonseed oil is very considerable nowadays.
It is cheap and excellent for domestic, industrial and pharmaceutic use.
The seeds are used in North America in dysentery and as a galactagogue, and the juice of the leaves as an emollient in diarrhoea and mild dysentery.
The pulp of the seeds, after the oil is extracted, yields a sweet material called gossypose, which is dextrogyrous and has the formula C 18 H 32 16 -f 5H 2 0.
The cotton itself, the part used in commerce as a textile, is also the portion of the plant most widely employed in therapeutics ; not only the fiber from this species is used, but also that of others that grow in the Philippines, the G. Barbadense, L.
