1893.] G. King -Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. 95 species, are coriaceous and have 10 to 13 pairs of nerves. The Perak plant may therefore belong to a distinct, but closely allied, species. Curtis' Penang specimens (No. 1401) are quite glabrous in all parts except the petals. 8. Dipterocarpus oblongifolius, Blume, Mus. Bot. Lugd. Bat. II, 36. A tall tree: young branches glabrous, dark-coloured, sparsely lenticillate; buds cylindric. Leaves coriaceous, oblong or elliptic-oblong, shortly and bluntly acuminate, the edges sub-undulate, the base cuneate; both surfaces shining, glabrous, the midrib and 13 to 16 pairs of straight bold nerves with a few stellate hairs along their sides: length 6 to 8 in., breadth 2 to 2.75 in., petiole .9 to 1.1 in. Racemes slightly supra-axillary, densely tawny-tomentose, bifurcating, each branch with 3 to 5 flowers and several linear membranous decid-uous bracts. Flowers about 2.5 in. long. Calyx-tube fusiform, slightly contracted at the mouth, 1 in. long, boldly 5-angled, densely stellate tawny-tomentose as are the 3 minor calyx lobes; the 2 larger linear-oblanceolate lobes sparsely stellate-pubescent, boldly 1-nerved and with 2 obscure lateral nerves. Ripe fruit unknown. Miq., Fl. Ind. Bat. I. pt. 2, p. 498; A. DC. Prod. XXI. 2, 614; Dyer in Journ. Bot. 1874, 105. D. stenopterus, Vesque, Comptes-Rendus, tome 78, p. 625; Journ. Bot. 1874, p. 150. Perak, Scortechini. Distrib. Borneo, Sumatra. Except as regards inflorescence, the Perak specimens of this are practivally glabrous. In Bornean specimens, however, the young parts, buds and petioles are fusco-tomentose. (Dyer l. c.) 9. Dipterocarpus grandiflorus, Blanco, Fl. Filipp. Ed. 2, 314. A tree 80 to 120 feet high: young branches rather stout, sub-compressed, at first hoary-puberulous, but finally quite glabrous, nearly black when dry; leaf-buds shortly ovoid, minutely pale-canescent. Leaves coriaceous, ovate-elliptic, shortly acuminate; the base broad, rounded or sub-truncate, sub-cordate; the edges or obscurelt undulate-crenate, both sur-faces glabrous; main nerves 14 to 16 pairs, spreading, rather straight, prominent on the lower, obsolete on the upper, surface; length 6 to 9 in., breadth 3.5 to 5 in.; petiole 2 to 3 in. long, glabrous. Racemes about 4-flowered. Flowers articulated to the rachis, 2 in. long. Calyx-tube 5-winged from base to apex. Petals linear-oblong. Fruit oblong, 2.5 in. long, wings stout, .5 in. or more in width; the 2 accrescent lobes of the calyx oblong, obtuse, glabrous, reticulate, 3-nerved, the mesial nerve the longest and most distinct, 7 to 9 in. long and 1.5 to 2 in. broad, the smaller calyx lobes sub-orbicular.
