Type locality. — Bongao and Tawi Tawi. Bongao (Bourns & Worcester) ; Bohol (Elera) ; Mindanao  (Cabrera) ; Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester)
Should the slow lemur prove to inhabit Mindanao, and the specimens agree with Cabrera's type of N. philippinus, and differ from the form found in Bongao and Tawi Tawi, both names will stand, though philippinus was proposed chiefly to replace menagensis, which Cabrera supposed to be without standing in nomenclature.
