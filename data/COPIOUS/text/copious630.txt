1920] 127 in. TWO NEW SIAMESE PLANTS. By H. N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S. I have found the following undescribed species in a small collection sent me by Dr. F. W. Foxworthy, Forest Research Officer, F.M.S. They were obtained by a collector of the Forest Department who accompanied the expedition of the F.M.S. Museums Department to the northern half of the Malay Peninsula in 1919 (antea pp. 65-126).
