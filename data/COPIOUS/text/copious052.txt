Several species representative of other genera have been reported, but there appears to be no specimen to substantiate any of the records. Borneo has representatives of nine genera and about fifteen species ; Java, seven genera and nine species; Sumatra, ten genera and thirteen species; Japan and Formosa, six genera and seven species. On the other hand only two genera and two species are known from Celebes.
One new species, Heosemys leytensis, from the southern part of Leyte, is described in this paper. Two specimens were collected there by Gregorio Lopez, together with other turtles to be used for dissecting in the zoological department of the University of the Philippines. He obtained forty specimens belonging to three species; namely, Cyclemys dhor, C. amboinensis, and Heosemys leytensis. It would appear that these land turtles are plentiful in that locality. In most localities they are rare; in collecting during seven years I have found less than a half dozen specimens, all of which belonged to Cyclemys amboinensis.
According to Manobo accounts a large turtle with a hard shell occurs in Agusan River. Rewards offered for specimens failed to bring forth this turtle; nevertheless, it is extremely
