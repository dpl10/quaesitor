"Whereas, it would appear that the rate of infection with intestinal worms is higher among the Filipinos than has ever been definitely reported for any other people; and
"Whereas, it would appear further that the death rate at Bilibid Prison has been materially reduced following the treatment of the prisoners for these infections; and
"Whereas the spread of infection with intestinal worms can be controlled almost absolutely by the proper disposal of human excreta ; and
"Whereas, the proper disposal of human excreta would, at the same time, remove one of the most dangerous channels for the dissemination of other infectious diseases; Therefore, be it
"Resolved, That the Philippine Islands Medical Association does petition the Government of the Philippine Islands, through the honorable the Secretary of the Interior, that a commission of five properly qualified members be appointed to decide upon the most practical and efficient methods for the disposal of human excreta that can be established in these Islands and that such appropriation be made and which means provided in accordance with the report of this commission as may be necessary to put into effect a practical and expedient working system for the disposal of human excreta"
