Swamp edges, in fringes (with Acacia) of savanna and rain-forest; ridge forest, primary forest on level land inundated in the wet season, swampy forest on peaty soil; also in Mynaceae-Vatica-Campnosperma forest on well-drained podsolground; 0-200 m alt.

NOTES 1. Fieldnotes. Once reported to have small stilt roots. Bark longitudinally fissured, brown or red-brown, or blackish brown, inside reddish, with some reddish exudate; reported to have a very offensive smell, or a strong disinfectant smell. Wood whitish to yellow. Leaves ± leathery, once recorded as bluish-green above. Flowers yellow. Fruits orange-yellow or orange, seeds orange or red. 2. Apparently closely related to H. sepikensis, one of the few other New Guinean species with 3-merous perianths. That species differs in its non-angular twig-apices, more elongate perianth, more slender inflorescences, membranous leaves, and apparently a different ecology. The present new species is mostly found in dry or wet habitats on poor peaty or podsolic soils. 3. Specimens of the present species were included by Sinclair (p. 125, 126) in H. spicata var. sepikensis (Mkgf.) Sinclair, a taxon which appears to be a heterogenous entity.
