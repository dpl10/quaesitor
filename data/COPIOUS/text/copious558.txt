New account of Horsfieldia 3 191

Ecology. Lowland forest: on sandy loam soil, sandy ridge in Shorea laevifolia forest: 0-800 m. Flowers and fruits throughout the year.

NOTES 1. Fieldnotes. Bark smooth, undulately fissured: inner bark c. 10 mm thick, laminated, reddish-brown or yellow-brown: wood whitish or pale brown, or reddish. Flowers yellow, the males very fragrant. 2. Specimens ot the present new subspecies were formerly determined by Sinclair as H. sucosa var. microcarpa, a name later on ( 1975. p. 20) published as H. bracteosa var. microcarya Sinclair. Other specimens belonging to Sinclair's var. microcarya, incl. the type, are presently referred to a new species H. pallidicaula. 3. H. sucosa is vegetatively very similar to H. pallidicaula and H. srerilis. the two being markedly different in the male flowers: these have a differently built androecium. and the pedicels are inarticulate at the base. 4. It seems as if the distributional area excludes that of the related and resembling species H. pallidicaula.
