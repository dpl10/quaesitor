PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 261 axillary in few-flowered racemose panicles. Occasionally Two inflores-cences from one axil. Rachis of inflorescence brrownish pubescent. Fruit 3 to 4 mm in diameter, 4 to 5 mm long; resin-cavities in lower part of fruit. Fruiting calyx with 2 long wings 3.5 to 4.3 cm long and 10 to 15 mm wide, with about 9 principal veins. Wings yellow when dry, the veins being of darker color and the fruit and base of wings very dark-brown. The bases of these two larger wings are expanded so as practically to conceal the small wings. Differs from H. odorata in shape of leaves and in its thick short petioles, in size of fruit and in expanded bases of the two enlarged calyx wings; from H. plagata in its narrower leaves, shorter petioles, smaller fruit, with expanded bases to calyx wings; from H. philippinensis in fruit and the absence of the long stipules.
