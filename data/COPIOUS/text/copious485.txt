10. Hopea sp. A form which differs from H. pierrei in having usually more uniform, smaller and narrower leaves and green, short-stalked fruit. The leaves seem to be without domatia. It is possible that some of the sterile material which has been referred to H. pierrei, may belong to this species and the next.  A single collection from the Island of Sibuyan, Elmer 12071, March 1910, in fruit. 

11. Hopea sp. This differs from H. pierrei in having a much larger fruit, which is sometime glutinous. Sibuyan, Elmer 12289, April 1910, in fruit. Luzon, Province of La Laguna, Phil PL. 397 Ramos, August 1910, in fruit. 

4. PENTACME A. DC. 

Sepals strongly imbricate. Petals broad, spreading. Stamens 15. Anthers oblong, on short broad filaments. Anther-cells equal, each pro-longed into a short appendix; the connective also prolonged, so that each anther has 5 apical appendages. Ovary glabrous, prolonged into a conical stylopodium; style filiform, glabrous. Stigma obtuse, indistinctly 3-toothed. The three outer segments of fruiting-calyx much larger than the others, narrowed into a stalk, but expanding into a broad base, which is adpressed to the lower portion of the fruit but does not enclose it. Four species known, two from the eastern Indian peninsula and two from the Philippine Islands. The wood is the least durable of any of our dipterocarps, but is considerably used because it is so abundant and readily worked and it is very satisfactory for purposes of temporary construction. There is quite a little resin present in the wood, but so far as I know, it is not used commercially. Pith with 12 to 25 resin-canals. Petiole with a semicircle of 7 to 9 vascular bundles, each with one resin-canal; 3 resin-canals in the central mass.
