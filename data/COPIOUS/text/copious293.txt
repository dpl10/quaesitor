In April 1810, a young tree flowered in the Botanic garden at Calcutta, and is the first that has blossomed, though there are young trees in the garden of from twelve to thirteen years growth. The original description of this tree is very correct, all I can add is that the stipules are large and falcate. The stamina about fifty. Stigma three-toothed. Germ three-celled, with two ovula in each attached to the top of the axis. The seed constantly single. The Eanbryo inverse, and without perisperm. Cary alobis. G^ert.
