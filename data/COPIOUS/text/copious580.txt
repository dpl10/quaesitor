pubescent on both sides. Racemes equalling or shorter than the leaves. Bracts subrotund, glabrous within pubescent and ciliate without, yellow, 4 mm long, 3 mm wide. Calyx laciniae lanceolate, outside covered with simple, adpressed, cinereous, sericeous hairs, glabrous within. Petals three or four times as long as the calyx, oblong, glabrous within, sericeous without. Stamens 15; appendix to connective sometimes longer than the anther cells. The three larger segments of the fruiting calyx oblan-ceolato, obtuse, 6-nerved, transverse veins distinct, margin minutely ciliate, clear, base dilated, sparsely villous with stellate hairs. Fruit ovoid, acuminate. Only the immature fruit has been described. None of our collections are in fruit and only one in flower. The sterile material shows a very great range of variability in shape and texture, and it is altogether probable that the following list contains representatives of what will prove to be several distinct species when we have more complete material for study. From observations made by different foresters it seems that this species and Hopea plagata produce wood of almost the same quality and appearance, but that the trees may be distinguished by the bark, which is thick, black and coarsely furrowed in H. plagata and thin, gray and not coarsely furrowed in this species. Both furnish a high grade of the timber known as yacal, which corresponds very closely to the selangan batu of Borneo and the thingan of Burma.
