Ahern 840 Sherman, collected in Mindanao in 1901, was determined by Merrill (Philip. Bur. For. Bull. 1 (1903) 40) as S. scrobiculata. It should be referred to S. guiso. Much of our material is sterile and it shows quite a range of variation. The mature leaves are usually glabrous or nearly so; but some specimens show leaves that are sparsely hairy; and some show a development of stellate hairs on the petioles and young shoots and on the midrib on the upper surface of the leaf. It is quite probable that there will prove to be more than one species in the material listed above, when we have more complete material for study and comparison. Common names: guijo, betik (Lag.), guisoc (V., Moro), sarai (Il.), yamban (Il.).

6. Shorea sp.

This form differs from S. guiso principally in having a dense pubescence of grayish color on the underside of the leaves and on the twigs. The pubescence is composed of large stellate hairs, such as are found on the leaves of S. eximia, S. squamata and S. philippinensis. The leaf-shape is very constantly that of S. guiso and the venation seems to be much the same. The wood may be slightly harder than that of guijo. LUZON, Province of Bataan, For. Bur. s. n.

Folia elliptica, oblonga, vel ovata; lamina 9 ad 15 cm longa, 4 ad 6 em lata; petiolo 1.5 ad 2.5 cm longo. Nervis secondariis 12 ad 16. Stipulae parvae fugaceae. Paniculae terminales. Petala intus glabra, extus sericea. Stamina circiter 30; filamenta subtus lata et sursum fastigata. Ovarium conoideum pilosum. Stylopodium 0. Stylus glaber. Gregarious in habit. Bark thick, black and fissured. Wood deep-red at the heart, the heart taking up a large proportion of the log. Logs often rotten at the heart. Base of leaf rounded, apex sharply acuminate. Midrib depressed and tomentose above, prominent and pilose beneath, Secondary veins prominent on underside of leaf. Tertiary veins parallel or reticulate, distinct and with regularly spaced large stellate hairs. This gives the underside of the leaf an appearance much like that of almon (S. eximia), but with a lesser degree of hairiness. When dried, the leaves often have a coppery color on the under surface. Stipules small, triangular, nerved, hairy, fugacious. Flowers in terminal panicles. Calyx and petals with dense grayish or yellowish tomentum on the outside,
