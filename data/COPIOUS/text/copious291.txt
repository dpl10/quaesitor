Uses.
— The decoction of the tender leaves is used as a gargle and wash in angina, aphthae, and wounds within the buccal cavity.
The peel of the fruit is highly astringent and in decoction is a useful agent in treating chronic diarrhoea, and locally in injections of lotions for leucorrhoea and inflamed haemorrhoids.
It should not be given when rectal tenesmus exists.
The Pharmacopoeia of India contains the following formula for preparing the decoction of the peel
Pulp of the fruit, mashed 60 grams.
Water 600 "
Boil for 15 minutes in a covered vessel, cool, filter and add water enough to make a liter.
Dose, 30-50 grams per diem.
This preparation is also used in astringent gargles and injections.
For internal use the decoction is rendered more active by adding a small quantity of cloves or cinnamon.
This mixture with the addition of opium gives excellent results in the treatment of diarrhoea among the natives of India and is highly recommended by Dr. Kirkpatrick.
The most important part of the pomegranate, however, is its root, the bark of which is a very efficient taenifuge and the most astringent portion of the plant.
It should be used fresh, as drying destroys its activity and gives negative results.
Many failures to expel the taenia are probably due to this fact.
According to Beranger-feand the root gives 25% to 40% of cures, whereas pumpkin seeds give but 5% to 10.
