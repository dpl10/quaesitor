PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 283 

in flower more or less unequal, two larger, on both sides with gray-stellate pubescence. Petals linear-oblong, obtuse, hairy outside. The five interior stamens on filaments longer than anthers, the ten outer on very short filaments; prolongation of connective short, conical. Ovary more or less immersed in the receptacle, tomentose with stellate hairs; style glabrous, 5-ribbed; stigma of five conical lobes, the two larger segments of fruiting-calyx 5 cm long, linear-oblong, narrowed at both ends, with five longitudinal nerves joined by oblique veins. Fruit (not ripe) globose, tomentose, 4 mm in diameter, the three cells still visible, one ovule more developed than the others. Blanco describes this species as having three seeds in the ripe fruit. This is incorrect. He must have been examining the unripe fruit and looking at the ovules, only one of which develops into a mature seed. Fruiting calyx with 2 long wings, 3.5 to 4 cm long, 12 to 18 mm wide, with about 5 principal longitudinal nerves; the three shorter wings of the fruiting-calyx 10 to 18 mm long, 3 to 4 mm wide, with 3 or 4 principal longitudinal veins. Wings membranous or chartaceous. This species contains very little resin. The bark is thin and dry and presents a rather mottled appearance. Closely resembling Vatica astrotricha of Cochin-China.
