PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 247 probable that they are identical and possible that they both will have to be referred to D. pilosus. This is particularly likely in view of the extreme variability in size, shape, and texture of the leaves at different ages in species of this genus. It will, however, require careful observation in the field before any such reduction can safely be made. Luzon, Province of Cagayan, For. Bur, 5248 Klemme, For. Bur. 17213, 11233 Curran, For.

A form with fruit which is distinctly obconical or top-shaped. Leaves and buds glabrous or nearly so, resembling material of D. turbinatus var. andamanicus King. Our material is all fragmentary, the fruit having been collected on the ground under the trees. Vidal, Sinopsis, Atlas (1883) XV, i. 14, f. c. represents a fruit which he calls D. turbinatus and which is said to have been brought from the Island of Panay. The fruit figured by Vidal is apparently not so top-shaped as in the specimens cited below. Some of the material from the Malay Peninsula in the herbarium at Kew under the name of D. turbinatus has fruit very much like the following : Luzon, Province of La Laguna, For.

Leaves and fruit larger than in D. hasseltii; secondary nerves 10 to 20 pairs ; petiole one-fourth to one-sixth the length of the blade. Fruit more than 2 em in diameter. Represented in our collection by only two detached old leaves from Palawan. The determination is therefore rather doubtful. Palawan, For. Bur. 12272 Wallace. Common name: apitong (Vis.).
