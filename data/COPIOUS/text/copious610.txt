1874.] of the Brmese Flora. 99 representation of D. alatus; but it is a faithful delineation of what I formerly identified (and I still believe correctly) with D. gonopterus, Turcz. I have not seen D. scaber, Ham. which is described as clothed with fascicled brown hairs. Doubtful species. 1. D. vestitus, Wall. Cat. 954 ; Hf. Ind. Fl. I. 295. Hab. Tenasserim, Tavoy (Gomez). Not seen by me but seems allied to, if not identical with, D. turbinatus, apparently differing by the calyx-lobes all short broadly deltoid (not 2 elongate). 2. D. scaber, Ham. in Mem. Wern. Soc. VI. 300 ; Hf. Ind. Fl. I. 297. Hab. Hills of southern Tippera (Ham). 3. D. angustifolius, WA. Prod. I. 84. (D. costatus, Roxb. Fl. Ind. II. 613). Hab. Chittagong Hills. Parashorea, Kurz. 1. P. stellata, Kurz in Journ. As. Soc. Beng. 1970, 66. (Shorea stellata, Dyer in Hf. Ind. Fl. I. 304). Hab. Frequent in the tropical forests of Martaban; raher rare along the eastern slopes of the Pegu Yomah, up to 1500 ftl. elevation. Fl. March; Fr. Apr. May. The generic distinctions of Parashorea do not consist in the develop-ment of the fruit-wings but in the aestivation of the calyx and the entirely exposed nut. Shorea, Roxb. Conspectus of species. * Inflorescence tomentose or velvety-pubescent. X Leaves chartaceous, when fu;;-grown glabrous or nearly so. Shorter calyx-lobes in fruit acuminate; stamens c. 20-25, … … S. obtusa. Shorter calyx-lobes in fruit blunt; stamens about 50, … … S. robusta. XX Leaves very coriaceous, appressed silvery beneath. Incompletely known; leaves apparently persistent, … … … S. Helferi. ** Inflorescence quite glabrous. Calyx quite glabrous, … … … … … S. floribunda. 1. S. obtusa, Wall. Cat. 966; Bl. Mus. Lugd. Bat. II. 32. t. 8 ; Hf. Ind. Fl. I. 306. Hab. Common in the Eng ang hill Eng forests all over Burma from Ava, Prome and Martaban down to Tenasserim, up to 2000 ft. elevation. Fl. March; Fr. Apr. May.
