SHRIMP FISHERIES  The catch of shrimp in the Philippines amounted to 2,641 metric tons (valued at US20 million) in 1954, compared with 1,618 tons in 1953, and 1,311 tons in 1952. Exports are confined to small salted shrimp (rangoon ala-mang) and varied in quantity between 1,300 pounds in 1952 and 16,700 pounds in 1954; in 1955 exports totaled 13,100 pounds. Salted shrimp are considered a delicacy by the Filipino residents in Guam and Hawaii.
The shrimp fishery in the Philippines is not specialized as in the United States. Shrimp are caught along with other varieties of fish by beam or otter trawls fished by motorized sampan-type wooden vessels, a United States dispatch dated January 11 from Manila states. The principal fishing grounds, with yields of 50 metric tons or over, are located in Carigara Bay, Guimaras Strait, Manila Bay, Magueda Bay, Samar Sea, San Miguel Bay, Sulu Sea, and Visayan Sea. There are no shrimp canneries and there is only one commercial freezer, located in Manila.
The principal species of shrimp are as follows: Peneaus indicus (Milne-edwards); P. canaliculatus (Olivier); P. affinis (Milne -Edwards); P. incisipes (Spence-bate); and P. monodon (Fabricius. The sizes (heads-on) vary between 4 and over 100 to the pound.
The shrimp fisheries do not receive governmental assistance and there are no foreign vessels engaged in this fishery. Licenses to operate fishing vessels, subject to taxation, are issued to United States citizens on the same basis as to citizens of the Philippines
The greatest potentialities for expansion of the shrimp catch is the cultivation of shrimp in fishponds. The shrimp, P. monodon  is now being cultivated in Philippine estuarine fishponds together with small varieties of shrimp and milkfish ( Chanos chanos)  P. monodon is considered to be a delicacy and commands the highest prices in the markets. The abundant supply of immature P. monodon found all over the Philippines where milkfish fry are caught makes the development of pond rearing of shrimp a promising enterprise.
