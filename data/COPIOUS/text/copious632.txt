Leaves coriaceous, elliptic, oblong or ovate-oblong, on the upper surface glabrous, on the lower surface glabrous except at the sparsely pubescent midrib, margins undulate, nerves on both sides very prominent, veins parallel at rightangles to the nerves, midrib depressed above, prominent beneath; length 12 — 23cm, width 6 — 12 cm; petiole 3,5 — 4 cm long, densely hirsute, consisting of tufts of stellate hairs, some short some long. Stipules 4 cm long, 9 mm wide, externally densely hirsuto-tomentose. Fruit ovoid, wings 13 cm long, 2 cm wide; tube of the fruiting calyx with 5 protuberances in its upper portion. Luzon, Prov. of Tayabas, Guinayangan, growing on sandy soil, sandstone (Merrill no. 2031 with fruit in April), (Merrill no. 2004). The nearest ally of this is Dipterocarpus Warbiirgii Brandis, from which, however, it differs by having smaller fruit. In D. lasiopodus the densely hirsute -pubescent petiole is most peculiar. Merrill says that the wood of this tree is used for bancas (native canoes) and that the tree occurs frequently in forests.
