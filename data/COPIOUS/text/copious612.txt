9821 DIPTEROCARPACEAE (Ashton) 355 Distr. Malesia: Borneo (Sarawak to Sabah; S.E. Borneo to P. Laut and Balikpapan). Ecol. Scattered in Mixed Dipterocarp forest on clay rich soils on undulating land and hills below 1000 m. Vern. Resak daun besar. r. sarawak, damar tingkis. Note. The fruit sepals of E. Borneo specimens ( V. ramiflora SLOOT.) are foliose and rather broad, these on Sarawak specimens narrow and incrassate. Further collections may justify distinction of two subspecies in V. oblongifolia.

(1968) 30; MEIJER & WOOOD, Sabah For. Rec. 5 (1964) 305, f. 52. Parts glabrous but for the shortly sparsely caducous pubescent calyx and shortly fulvous caducous pubescent ovary. Twig to 1 mm apically. slender, smooth to rugulose. Bud to 2 by 1 mm, conical, acute. Stipule to 16 by 3.5 mm. hastate, subacute, caducous. Leaves 8-20 by 3-7 cm. thinly coriaceous, elliptic to lanceolate; base ± narrowly cuneate: acumen to 1 .5 cm long, narrow; nerves 4-6 pairs, rather broad, slightly raised on both surfaces, more prominently so beneath, curved, continuing almost parallel to the margin before terminating, at 45 -50 (-70 ); midrib broad, rounded, slightly raised on both surfaces; tertiary nerves subscalariform; petiole 1-1.3 cm long. Panicle to 28 cm long, terminal or axillary. lax. spreading, glabrous, terete; doubly or trebly branched. Flower bud to 1.5 cm long, slender; calyx shortly sparsely pubescent; corolla rich lemon-yellow; appendage to connective rudimentary; flowers otherwise typical. Calyx lobes subequal. to 12 by 4 mm. ovate, obtuse, tapering to 3.5 mm broad at base, coriaceous, glabrous, becoming reflexed. Nut to 1.2 by 1.2 cm. globose, without style remnant, shortly fulvous pubescent. Distr. Malesia: Borneo (Rejang valley to Kinabalu; E. Sabah). Ecol. Clay rich soils, low hills and ridges; to 1400 m in Kinabalu area. Vern. Resak ranting puteh. r. puteh. Note. Differing from the closely related V. hullettii of Malaya in the narrow fugaceous hastate stipules and totally glabrous young parts and petiole.

Note. The taxa I here recognise as subspecies are rather constant and rarely difficult to identify. Though the full range of variation they together manifest is great, the distinctive characters of the depressed twig and short dense vinose indumentum unites them as a single entity.
