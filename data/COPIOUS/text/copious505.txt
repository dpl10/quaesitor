THE CRESTED LIZARD HAWK (AVICEDA JERDONI ) IX THE RHHJPPINES

The genus Avicula contains about five species of small hawks distributed through the Old World tropics. Two forms of this genus have been described from the Philippines: Hyptiopus magnrrostns Kaup, 18-tn, and Baza leucopais Sharpe, 1888. The latter was based on a single specimen from the island of Palawan. The application of these two names to the Crested Lizard Hawks of the Philippines has varied. Modern authors agree that the Philippine birds belong to the Indo-malaysian species Aviceda jerdoni. Peters (1931: 196) used the name A. j. magnirostris for the populations of Luzon and Mindanao, and attributed those of the islands of Romblon, Samar, and Palawan to a subspecies to which he attached Sharpe's name leucopias. He was followed in this treatment by Hachisuka (1934: 34-35) and Swann and Wetmore (1936: 294-295) ; the former author adopted the emendation to "leiicopais'' published by Whitehead (1890: 43) at Sharpe's request.
The most recent manual on Philippine birds (Delacour and Mayr, 1946: 40) abandons the concept of two subspecies, using the name magnirostris for the birds of all five islands (Palawan, Iaizou, Romblon, Samar, and Mindanao) from which Aviceda has supposedly been recorded. The description
