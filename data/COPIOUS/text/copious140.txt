Endemic. There are often produced in the leaf-axils hard pale-green finely lobulated and rounded masses viscous on the surface and formed of crowded coral-like abortive branches. These may be of similar character to those on Hopea Wightiana, Wall, as figured in Wight, 111. t. 37. Var. /3. may be a separate species. 

S. brevipetiolaris, Thw. in Trim. Cat. Ceyl. PI. 9, is not a member of this genus, but perhaps referable to Balanocarpus (q. v.).
