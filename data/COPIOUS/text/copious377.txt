1893.] G. King â€” Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula. 121 slightly curved, thin hut prominent heneath when dry, as are the transverse veins; length 3.5 to 6.5 in., breadth 1.5 to 2.25 in.; petiole .35 in., densely stellate-pubescent, scurfy. Stipules deciduous, ovate-lanceolate, nerved, stellate-puherulous. Panicles axillary and termi-nal, few-flowered, tawny-tomentose, (shorter than the leaves [?]); the bracts in pairs, unequal, elliptic-oblong, blunt, nerved, pubescent on both surfaces. . Segments of calyx (fide Burck) unequal, the three outer larger, imbricate. Petals minutely tomentose inside. Stamens 15, in two rows.. Hopea ? Maranti, Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. Suppl., 489; A. DC. Prod. XYI, 2, p. 635. Perak: King.s Collector, No. 880. Malacca: Derry, No. 952. Distrib. Sumatra, Bangka. The Perak specimens are not in flower; and I have seen none from elsewhere that are. The above imperfect description of the flower ha.s therefore been copied from Burck (Ann. Jard. Bot. Buitenzorg, VI. 217). The Perak specimens perfectly agree, as to leaves, with an authentic specimen of Miquel.s from Sumatra, in the Calcutta Her-barium. Miquel never saw either flower or fruit. In fact, of the twenty new species of Dipterocarpece described by this anthor in the supplement to his Flora of the Netherlands India, the flowers are des-cribed in only two, and in these but partially ! 20. Shobea eximia, Scheff. in Nat. Tijdschr. Ned. Ind. XXXI, 349. A shrub or small tree; young branches petioles and under-surfaces of leaves stellate-setulose. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic-oblong, or ob-lanceolate-oblong, acuminate, narrowed to the rounded or sub-cuneate base: upper surface glabrous except the tomentose midrib, shining, the nerves depressed: nnder surface scabrid, pale brown, the reticulations midrib and 17 to 21 pairs of spreading nerves prominent: length 6.5 to 11 in., breadth 225 to 3.25 in., petiole .25 to .35 in. Stipules in pairs, persistent, ovate, acuminate, longer than the petioles, reticulate, laxly pubescent and wartcd. . Wings of fruiting-calyx linear-lanceolate, obtuse: the three larger narrow at the base, 3.2 to 3.6 in. long, -5 in. broad, sparsely pubescent, 9-nerved; the two shorter and narrower 1.6 in. long. Fruit elongated-ovoid, acuminate, minute-ly whitish-tomentose.. Burck in Ann. Jard. Bot. Buitenzorg VI, 218. Vatica? eximia, Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. Suppl. 486; A. DC. Prod. XVI, 2, 623.
