30 I. THE SEDILI RIVERS February. The following events might overlap into March. Gregarious flowering: — Buchanania lucida (see also August), Campnosperma, Croton laevifolius (small undergrowth tree, fruiting in May), Eugenia spp., Lithocarpus spp., various Lauraceae and Myristicaceae, Macaranga baccaureifolia (small undergrowth tree, fruiting in June), Neesia, Pometia, Kopsia singapurensis, shrubby species of Ixora. Fruiting: — Calophyllum spp. (evidently from flowering in Oct. -Nov.), Connarus grandis. New leaves: — Shorea spp., Sindora coriacea (deciduous), Macaranga baccaureifolia (deciduous).

March. The main flowering of trees began in this month of uncertain rain. Most striking was the leaf-fall and flowering of Cratoxylon formosum; the bare crowns flushed with reddish pink from the flowers and opening buds, revealed the great abundance of this tree (up to 30 m high) in the swamp-forest. Not being a timber-tree sought by Chinese wood-cutters, it flourished after their selective logging.

Gregarious flowerings:— Castanopsis spp., Cerbera odollam, Crateva religiosa, Elaeocarpus spp., Entada phaseoloides, Eugenia spicata, Flagellaria, Gardenia tubifera, Gluta velutina (with flowering prolonged into June or July), Goniothalamus spp., Horsfieldia irya, Poikilospermum spp., Vitex clarkeana.

Fruiting: — Mesua ferruginea, Myristica elliptica, Neoscortechinia forbesii, Nephelium glabrum, Vatica wallichii. New leaves: — Dalbergia beccarii (riverside climber), Koompassia malaccensis, Pongamia pinnata var. xerocarpa, Polyalthia sclerophylla (beginning to shed all its old leaves, developing olive-buff new leaves), Calophyllum sclerophyllum (complete leaf-change but no inflorescences; see July).

These events might begin in February or be prolonged into April. Regarding Koompassia malaccensis, Medway (1972) recorded the development of new leaves about every six months but flowering was uncertain; only one general flowering was observed in the years 1963-1969.

April, May. Gregarious flowering: — Barringtonia filirachis, Chisocheton amabilis, Cratoxylon arborescens, Dillenia excelsa, Elaeocarpus macrocerus, Eugenia spicata, Garcinia bancana, Gardenia tubifera, Horsfieldia irya, Jackia, Lophopetalum multinervium, Mussaendopsis, Myristica elliptica, Palaquium xanthochymum, Pandanus helicopus (prolonged into August or September), Pentaspadon officinalis (see also October), Polyalthia sclerophylla, Premna trichostoma (riverside climber), Pterospermum javanicum, Shorea spp., Sterculia bicolor, Vitex peralata, Ixora congesta and I. lobbii (continuing to flower in the undergrowth). Aquatic plants flowering: — Barclaya, Cryptocoryne spp. Fruiting: — Bhesa paniculata, Connarus grandis, Gnetum gnemon var. brunonianum. New leaf: — Podocarpus neriifolius. In May 1935, when there was the heavy flowering of dipterocarps, many trees of Scaphium macropodum became completely deciduous and flowered on the new shoots. I recorded also that this species changed its leaves in Singapore in November 1935, then flowered for three weeks on the bare twigs, and developed new leaves in January 1936. Medway (1972) records two flowerings of S. macropodum (as S. affine) during the years 1963-1969. Sterculia bicolor seemed to ripen its fruits and shed it leaves in March-April along the Sedili Besar before it flowered in May. June, July. Gregarious flowering: — Connarus grandis, Elaeocarpus spp., Eugenia cerina, Fagraea racemosa, Nephelium rubescens, Tristania sumatrana (second flowering), Vitex clarkeana (see March).
