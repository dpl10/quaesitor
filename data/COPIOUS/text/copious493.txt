(Braudis in Journal Linnean Society, vol. xxxi, (1895) p. 1.) Resinous trees, rarely shrubs, mostly evergreen. Leaves alternate, stipulate, simple, penniveined, generally coriaceous, petioles mostly thickened below the blade. Young shoots and inflorescence, calyx and outside of petals in most species pubescent, hairs 1-celled, generally stellate or fasciculate. Fl. bisexual, regular, pentamerous, in spikes or racemes, these often unilateral and mostly paniculate. Receptacle fleshy, broad, flat or obconical, often concave, bearing on its outer edge the calyx, the segments of which as a rule are much enlarged in fruit. Petals contorted, stamens 5, L0, or more, anthers introrse, adnate to filaments, which are mostly short, the connective being often pre-longed beyond the anthers. Ovary 3-celled, often prolonged into a fleshy stylopodium, in some cases immersed in the hollow receptacle. Two collateral ovules in each cell, attached to the inner angle. Fruit 1-seeded, pericarp coriaceous, indehiscent. Seed with or without albumen, cotyledons fleshy, bifid, often stipitate, in most species filled with starch, in others with oil. while some contain both. Remarkable anatomical characters. — Resin ducts are found in the pith of the young stem and branches, in the pith of all vascular bundles, in the petiole, midrib, nerves and veins of leaves as well as of those bundles which run through the bark. The walls of these ducts are lined by a stratum of thin-walled secreting cells. In many species similar ducts are also found In the wood, They contain an essential oil, known as wood-oil in t he ease of Dipterocarpus, as camphor-oil in the case of Drylobalanops. Exposed to the air, outside or in cavities of the trunk, these essential oils are transformed into resin or camphor. Cortical leaf traces. — Some distance below the node the leaf traces separate from
