but it is clear that throughout the range there is some variation in the relative length. However, the shape is otherwise fairly constant in being cylindrical, very few stumps being at all flaring, and there are usually three to five points at the tip.
The arm spines do not normally exceed the arm breadth in length, as Lamarck commented, and indeed are often somewhat shorter, the longer ones usually just exceeding twice the segment length. Most of them are finely rugose for almost their entire length but the second and third spines from above may be smooth on the basal half, at least on the side facing the disc. These longer spines have their sides parallel or slightly tapering and the ends truncated so they cannot be described as at all clavate. The lowest spine distally (Text-fig. 4p) is always more or less comb-like with multiple teeth but in the specimen from the Seychelles the terminal tooth may be unusually enlarged (Text-fig. 4q).
The colour pattern normally consists of the well-defined dark intersegmental spots on the arms said to be characteristic of punctolimbata.
Distribution. Known from Mauritius, E. Africa, the islands of the western Indian Ocean, the Maldive Islands, Ceylon, the East Indies, Philippines, southern Japan, the S. Pacific islands (but not the Hawaiian Islands) and northern Australia. Records from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf need confirmation, being possibly based on material of M. hirsuta, demessa or elongate.

Description. The holotype has dd. 16 mm. and arm length c. 300 mm. and c. 225 mm. on two arms measured, giving ratios of i  19 and i  14.
The disc is closely covered with elongated stumps (Text-fig. 3p) having two to five points, most often three; most of them are flared from close to the base with transparent flanges ending in the points. The longer stumps are c. 0-4 mm. long. The radial shields are about 6 mm. in length and closely covered with stumps similar to but smaller than those on the disc scales; again these are mostly trifid. On the ventral side of the disc the stumps tend to have fewer points, especially the proximal ones, which may consist of a single tapering thorn. These stop short of the genital slits and the oral shields, which are broad rhombic, with length  breadth 1-25  1-9 mm.
