PHILIPPINE SNAILS OF THE FAMILY ENDODONTIDAE

INTRODUCTION
A new endodontic! snail in Chicago Natural History Museum, collected on Mindanao by the Philippine Zoological Expedition, 1946-47, has prompted a review of the synonymy, generic position, and distribution of the Philippine Island Endodontidae. This paper is a by-product of a survey of the genera of Indo-pacific Endodontidae undertaken at the University of Michigan in 1954-56. Completion of the major project has been delayed, and publication, at this time, of data on the few Philippine species seems worth while.
Dr. Henry van der Schalie of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (hereafter UMMZ) permitted me to study material under his charge, and Dr. Fritz Haas of Chicago Natural History Museum (hereafter CNHM) aided this study in many ways. The excellent illustrations are the work of Chicago Natural History Museum Staff Artist, E. John Pfiffner.
systematics
The family Endodontidae probably contains the most primitive of the living sigmurethrous pulmonates. Predominately a southern hemisphere taxon, only in New Zealand, southern Australia, Tasmania, New Caledonia, and on the islands of the Pacific Ocean have the endodontids undergone such extensive adaptive radiations that they form an important part of the molluscan fauna.
