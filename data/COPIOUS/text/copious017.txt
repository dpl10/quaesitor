surdus.
None of the clutches have been positively identified with this species.
Etymology.
--Named for Dioscoro S. Rabor, Filipino ornithologist and mammalogist, who added greatly to our knowledge of the ranges of Philippine amphibians and reptiles.
COMPARISONS.
— Platymantis rabori differs from guentheri, negrosensis, luzonensis, and banahao as indicated in the diagnosis and key.
ECOLOGICAL NOTE.
--Preferred microhabitat is arboreal ferns or leaf axils of Pandanus.
Of 56 examples collected in 1962 in original forest near Cantaub, Siena Bullones.
Bohol Island 50 were from arboreal ferns, 4 from leaf axils of Pandanus and 2 from duff on the forest floor.
The elevation is between 500 and 800 m (Brown and Alcala 1963).
This contrasts with Platymantis guentheri with 41 of 57 specimens from the
forest floor and only 9 from arboreal ferns.
In a later (1972) study of the arboreal fern microhabitat in the same forest area on Bohol, 88 specimens were P. rabori and 20 were P. guentheri.
The height range of the ferns for P. rabori is 05 to 125 m.
RANGE.
— Populations are recorded from Bohol, Leyte, and Mindanao islands.
