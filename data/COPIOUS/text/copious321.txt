Dipterocarpus. polyandria monogynia. 611 from the Shoreas, and used in the Marine yards, as a substitute for pitch. 2. H. eglandulosa. R. Leaves ovate, oblong, obtusely acuminate, no glands in the axills of the veins. A very beautiful large tree, a native of the hills of Tipperah, from thence plants have been introduced into the Botanic garden twelve years, and are not more than ten or twelve feet high though perfectly healthy. Trunk perfectly straight, as are the branches, which are scattered equally all round, spreading and dividing much, but never drooping ; the bark in this species is of a greyish colour whereas in odorata it is dark brown, which mark alone is sufficient to distinguish them. 3. H. scaphula. R. Leaves elliptic, entire, smooth. Panicles terminal. Stamina inserted on the margin of an expanded receptacle in which the germ is inserted. Boil shora is the vernacular name in Mascal Island where the tree is indigenous and its trunk so immensely large, as to be made into canoes by the Mug inhabitants. Flowering time January. 

DIPTEROCARPUS. Gaert. Gen. Char. Calyx one-leaved, permanent, two of the five divisions of its border large, and growing with the pericarp into two very long, scariose wings. Corol fivepetalled. Germ superior, three-celled; cells two-seeded; attachment interior. Nut ovate, one-celled, one-seeded. Embryo inverse, no perisperm. 

This genus is so nearly related to Shorea and Hopea, as to induce a belief that they might all be referred to one, but a nearer inspection of the calyx and corol of each
