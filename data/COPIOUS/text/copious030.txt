Rhinolophus virgo K. Anderson, 1905
The yellow-faced horseshoe bat is an endemic species widespread within the Philippines.
It is usually encountered in primary lowland forest from 250 to 1100 m; several records are from caves (Heaney et al, 1991; Rickart et al, 1993).
We obtained one adult female from the edge of a small tree-fall gap in primary montane forest at 1275 m on 22 March 1995 (Site 7).
It has small mammae and showed no indication of reproductive activity.
Cranial dimensions (Table 5) fall within the range of those from Leyte and Maripipi but are slightly smaller than those from Mindanao (Mt. Kitanglad; Rickart et al, 1993; Heaney et al, unpubl. data).

Murina cyclotis Dobson, 1872
The round-eared tube-nosed bat is widespread in southern Asia and was previously known in the Philippines from a few specimens from the central and southern portion of Greater Luzon as well as Greater Mindanao, Sibuyan, and Siquijor, with records from disturbed and primary lowland and montane forest from 250 to 1500 m (Heaney et al, 1991, 1998, 1999, unpubl. data; Rickart et al, 1993; Ruedas, 1994; Lepiten, 1997).
We netted one adult female in May 1994 in secondary lowland forest at 1000 m (Site 4).

Pipistrellus javanicus (Gray, 1838)
The Javan pipistrelle is found from Korea to Java and throughout the Philippines.
It is generally common in primary montane forest and uncommon in primary lowland and mossy forest, though it has been found from sea level to 2250 m (Ingle, 1992; Heaney et al, 1998, 1999, unpubl. data).
A single skin without a skull, tentatively identified as this species, was obtained from Camiguin by the 1960s surveys.
In March 1995, two were netted in primary montane forest at 1275 m (Site 7).
Cranial and external measurements (Table 5) are comparable with those of a series from Mindanao (Mt. Kitanglad) in most dimensions (Heaney et al, unpubl. data).
