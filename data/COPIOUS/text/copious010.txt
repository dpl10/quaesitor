Nut to 11 by 8 mm. broadly ovoid, tapering, shortly evenly densely buff pubescent; style remnant to 2.5 mm long, acute. Distr. Malesia: Malaya. Sumatra (W. coast: Tapanuli. Sibolga to Painan. Bangkinang; P. Musala). Borneo (Kapuas hinterland. Sarawak to S.W. Sabah. S.E. Borneo). Philippines (Mindanao). Ecol. Sandy soils on coastal hills (especially in Borneo); inland ridges to 1 500 m (especially in Malaya and Sumatra). Vern. Meranti sarang punai bukit (Malaya), mandirawan (Sumatra), seraya punai bukit (Sabah). Notes. Formerly I pointed out (Gard. Bull. Sing. 31, 1978. 47) that S. plagata and S. agsaboensis (from Mindanao) represented the same species and referred these names to S. pauciflora. owing to the leaf shape and 8 pairs of nerves, pointing out. however, that the Philippine plants differed in the usually small leaf-size and the usual but not consistent presence of small axillary domatia up to the midrib. I also indicated that flowers would be needed for confirmation. J. P. ROJO has now collected and described (1977. I.e.) these flowers (ROJO 292. Agusan del Norte. Mindanao) and correctly pointed out that they place the species in a different section. Mutica, S. pauciflora being in sect. Brachypterae. ROJO’s excellent field description alludes to the fissured bark and bluish-red corolla, pink at the base. This matches Shorea sect./subsect. Mutica. while the description of the corolla is distinctive and clearly matches that of S. ovata. in which the leaves also bear 8 pairs of nerves and pubescent axillary domatia. Though not closely resembling the leaves of S. ovata as it occurs in Borneo, the Philippine specimens so much resemble specimens from Sumatra and West Malaysia, that I am convinced of their conspecificy. This conclusion is strengthened by ROJO’s comment that it is in Mindanao a species of high ridges, exactly as is S. ovata. except in northern Borneo where it spreads down onto sandy soils in the lowlands.
