LIST OF BIRDS COLLECTED BY THE STEERE EXPEDITION TO THE PHILIPPINES, WITH LOCALITIES AND WITH BRIEF PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUPPOSED NEW SPECIES.
For convenience of reference the same arrangement of orders and families has been used as in Sharpe's and Lord Walden's published lists of Philippine birds. The names of genera have been made to agree with those given in the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, as far as that has been issued. As the supposed new species are in almost all cases representative forms, each strictly limited to one or several adjacent islands, they have been named, as far as possible, to show their distribution. The names of distinct islands only are given in the localities collected from. In the few cases where collections were made from more than one place in a single island, these were generally so near together and so similar in conditions that they showed little difference in fauna. The islands are given in the order in which they were visited and collected in, and the date at which a species was collected, in any island, can be readily made out from the following schedule
Paragua, August and September, 1887. Mindanao, October. Basilan, November. Mindanao, again in December. Guimaras, December. Panay, January, 1888. Negros and Siquijor, February. Cebu and Bojol, March. Samar and Leyte, April. Masbate and Marinduque, May. Mindoro, June. Luzon, July.
