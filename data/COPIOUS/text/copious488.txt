This species suggests a form referred to by King in Journ. As Soc Beng. 62 » (1893) 99: "A Perak species (Herb. Scortechini mixed with No. 1478) represented by fruits something like those of D. fagineus Vesque, but with the calyx-tube winged, not angled." It is evident that the relationship here must be very close, but identity is doubtful. This species is our only representative of the § Angulati It seems noteworthy in that section in that the angles are developed until they resemble wings. It is most closely related to Dipterocarpua fagineus Vesque, of the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, but differs from that species in having slightly smaller fruits, which are more sharply angled and with more scantily developed venation in the fruit wings. 15.
