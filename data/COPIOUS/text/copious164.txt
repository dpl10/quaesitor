PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 277 

cm wide. Petiole 1 to 3 cm long. Secondary nerves 14 to 22 pairs, arching ; tertiary parallel, prominent. Flowers sessile, in secund bracteate spikes, each flower subtended by two unequal bracts. Ovary pubescent, narrowed into a glabrous filiform style, much longer than ovary; stigma minute. Fruiting calyx with 3 wings 9 to 12.5 cm long, 15 mm wide, narrowed below, but base dilated, tightly enclosing the fruit; transverse veins and 7 to 9 longitudinal veins prominent. Fruits abundantly in August, but the fruit is quickly eaten by wild hogs, etc., perhaps for contained fat, and in a very few days, it is difficult to find any of the seeds remaining. The resin is sometimes collected from the tree for torches, etc., although, I think, not on a commercial scale. The timber is used in great quantities under the name of almon.
