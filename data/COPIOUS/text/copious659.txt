370 Flora Malesiana ser. vol 92 4-1 1 by 13-25cm, narrowly elliptic, thinly coriaceous: tapering to a narrowly obtuse base and to a 1 cm long acumen; margin ± narrowly revolute; nerves 12-14 pairs, arched, slender but prominent beneath, elevated above, with short less prominent secondary nerves; tertiary nerves subreticulate, distinctly elevated on both surfaces but more prominent beneath as also the midrib; petiole 4-9 mm long, short. Panicle to 5 cm long, slender, terminal or axillary, irregularly doubly branched. Flower bud lo 5 by 3 mm, lanceolate, small; sepals subequal; anthers narrowly oblong; appendages prominent, deltoid; style columnar, expanding distally, slightly longer than ovary; stigma deltoid; flowers otherwise typical. Mature fruit unknown; very young fruit with subequal reflexed calyx lobes. Distr. Malesia: Philippines (Zamboanga, Mindanao), twice collected.  53. Vatica pentandra ASHTON, Gard. Bull. Sing. 31 (1978) 24. Twigs, petioles and panicles persistently shortly scabrid fulvous pubescent, calyx outside + caducously so, parts of petals exposed in bud and ovary persistently evenly buff puberulent. Twigs c. 2 mm apically, ribbed, much branched, ascending. Leaf buds minute. Leaves 18-45 by 9-20 mm, elliptic, thinly coriaceous, with subrevolute margins, obtuse to broadly cuneate base and ± deeply retuse apex; nerves 4-5 pairs, ascending, at c. 45 , slender, hardly elevated on either surface though more so below; petiole 4-11 mm long, slender, hardly geniculate. Panicle to 4 cm long, slender, singly branched; branchlets bearing to 3 flowers. Flower buds to 9 by 3 mm; stamens 5, in a single whorl; flowers otherwise typical. Fruit unknown. Distr. Malesia: East Borneo (Central Kutei). Ecol. Unknown, lowlands. Note. The only Vatica with but 5 stamens; the leaves are among the smallest and most distinctive in the genus also. 54. Vatica cauliflora ASHTON, Gard. Bull. Sing. 31 (1978)25. Twigs, petioles and panicles persistently scabrid fulvous pubescent; midrib beneath caducously so; calyx outside, parts of petals exposed in bud and ovary persistently evenly buff puberulent. Twigs c. 3 mm apically, stout, ribbed; leaf buds minute. Leaves 7-22 by 2.5-8 cm, oblanceolate, coriaceous, with subrevolute margins, obtuse to subcordate base and + prominent caudate acumen; nerves 14-16 pairs, ascending at 50-60", prominent beneath, evident but depressed above, as also the many secondaries; tertiaries reticulate, barely elevated though evident on both surfaces; midrib prominent beneath, less so above; petiole 10-18 mm long, c. 2 mm 0, relatively slender. Panicles to 6 cm long, solitary, axillary, doubly branched, many-flowered. Flower buds to 7 by 2 mm, lanceolate, otherwise typical. Distr. Malesia: Ulu Kapuas, W. Borneo. Ecol. Locally frequent along river banks. Note. This species is distinguished by the nerves which are depressed above, by the caudate acumen and slender petiole. Very young fruit indicate a possible affinity with V. venulosa BL. 

55. Vatica glabrata ASHTON, sp. nov. V. mangachapoi BLCO simulans lamina nervis intrinsecus 9-11 ascendentihus petiolo longissimo partibus glabrescentibus ovariis excepto differt. Medium-sized tree, to 20 m tall, 1 m girth. Apical buds and ovary densely ocherous puberulent, young parts sparsely caducously so, otherwise glabrous. Stipules to 12 by 8 mm, elliptic, obtuse, not at first caducous, leaving a more or less prominent falcate scar. Leaves 6-15(-22) by (2-)2.5-7 cm, lanceolate, coriaceous, + concave, lustrous, with obtuse base and prominently attenuate to 15 cm long acumen; nerves 9-11 pairs, ascending, slender, elevated on both surfaces but more so below, with ± short secondaries; tertiaries reticulate, elevated on both surfaces. Petiole 1.8-4 cm long, slender, very long. Panicles to 7 cm long, irregular, 1-axillary or terminal. Flowers white, as in other species. Fruit unknown. Distr. Malesia: Borneo: Sarawak, S 34865, 36852 (holotype in K, in fl.), Dulit range, Ulu Tinjar, Baram; BRUN 2526, 2533, Ulu Medamit, Limbang. Ecol. Local, scattered in submontane forest at 1200-1500 m on acid soils overlying sandstone immediately below the mossy forest zone. Notes. I collected this species in April 1958 while on an expedition to the Pagon range. Fallen fruit, apparently from this species, were also collected but were lost in a river accident on the return: they were of the Sunaptea type, with two long and three short sepals free to the base. The new collections from Sarawak, and more particularly the type differ in their concave laminae and prominent subamplexicaul subpersistent stipules. The unusually long slender petioles, 9-1 1 pairs of ascending nerves and glabrous young twigs and inflorescences distinguish the four collections from those of V. mangachapoi BLCO which it otherwise resembles and convince me that they represent but a single species. 

Doubtful species 

56. Vatica obtusa BURCK, Ann. Jard. Bot. Btzg 6 (1887) 228; MERR. En. Born. ( 1 92 1 ) 409; SLOOT. Bull. Jard. Bot. Btzg III, 9 (1927) 126, nom. illeg.. non (WALL.) STEUD. The type, TEYSMANN HB 11352, from Karimata, is in flower. It is indistinguishable in this state from V. umbonata (HOOK. f.) BURCK and V. pauciflora (KORTH.) BL. 

Excluded 

Vatica imbricata SLOOT. Bull. Jard. Bot. Btzg III, 16 (1940) 452, f. 10. is according to KOSTERMANS, Reinwardtia 7 (1969) 426 = Mesua acuminatissima (MERR.) KOSTERM. (Gutiiferae).
