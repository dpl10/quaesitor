Volume 116, Number 5, November and December 2005 343 As for the botanical source of amber from Burma, Grimaldi et al. (2002) indicated that “Metasequoia is possibly the source of the amber” [modern classifications tend to place Metasequoia in the Cupressaceae (Judd et al., 2002)]. Studies with solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using carbon 13 nucleus suggest that burmite and other fossil resins belong to a large, worldwide assemblage (fossile resin Group B, Lambert and Poinar 2002). Some of the Group B resins perhaps belong in the Dipterocarpaceae (modern resins, Group D, Lambert et al., 2002), although this has not been firmly established. Modern geographic sources for Group B fossil resins include Borneo, Sumatra, Australia, Papua New Guinea, India, and North America. Nevertheless, Group B fossil resins are spectroscopically distinct from the partially sympatric Agathis-related plants (fossil resins, Group A of Lambert et al., 2002; mod-ern resins, group CA, Cupressaceae and Araucariaceae of Lambert et al., 2005). Figs. 2. A second flower in Burmese amber showing their possibly entomophillous traits. Note tubular gynoecium (g), abundant pilosity ℗ , and possible food sources (fs). Both flowers illustrated in this paper are deposited in the private collection of Ron T. Buckley. A handful of flowers has been described from younger amberiferous formations, such as those from the Dominican Republic and/or the Baltic region, including the families Aracaceae (Bogner 1976), Arecaceae (Poinar 2002), Fagaceae (Mai 2003), and Leguminosae (Poinar and Brown, 2002). Interestingly, no flowers have yet been described from Lebanese amber (Poinar and Milki 2001), which is Aptian (Grimaldi et al., 1993) to Hauterivan (Roth et al., 1996) in age, approximately 120-135 Ma, although most localities appear to be closer to 120 Ma (Labandeira to Santiago-Blay,
