"Pith of internode with 10 to 20 small peripheral resin-canals. Petiole; peripheral bundle-system with 3 to 10 resin-canals, the central with a few resin-canals or without them." About 45 species known, with probably 5 species in the Philippines. Quite probably, some of the very variable material which is lumped under V. mangachapoi may be referable to other species when more complete specimens are secured.

This species is very incompletely understood ; but, I have followed the interpretation accepted by Brandis. A moderate-sized tree of the hill forests. Not gregarious. Bark light-grayish and rather smooth. Wood hard and heavy, brownish, fine-grained, resembling yacal but finer-and straighter-grained. Glabrous, excepting inflorescence and young shoots, which are clothed with stellate tomentum. Stipules small, caducous. Leaves pale on both sides, coriaceous, lanceolate; blade 7.5 to 12.5 cm long; petiole 1 cm long. Secondary nerves 7 to 9 pairs; tertiary reticulate. Flowers 1 cm long, on pedicels nearly as long as the calyx, in racemes which are not unilateral, these arranged in terminal and axillary racemose panicles. Pseudoterminal flowers frequent between the main axis and a branch of panicle. Calyx-segments
