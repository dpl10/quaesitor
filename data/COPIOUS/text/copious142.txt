This beautiful species is doubtless often confused with Ch. marica L, which it somewhat resembles, and it is probably more widely distributed than is at present known. The specimens from the Gulf of Siani vary greatly both in outline and in colour, most of them are not as high as is shown in Smith's figure (but the measurements given in the text agree fairly well with those of my specimens), and resemble more closely Reeve's figure (loc. cit), which I think ought to be referred to the present species. The coloration varies exceedingly, there are scarcely two specimens which are alike in regard to painting; pale-red, white, and yellow individuals occur, with brown or red zigzag-lines, spots and rays, and many other paintings. In the interior of the valves the colour varies from entirely white to dark lilac. As the lamella; upon the posterior end are often only' slightly conspicuous, I think that Adams's and Reeve's species Venus costellifera is nothing but an individual of Ch. recognita, Sm, with worn or only slightly developed lamellae; the other distinguishing characters given for V. costellifera are also not very good. H. A. PILSBRY,  under the name oi Ch. hizenensis, has described a very closely allied form from Japan.

This species varies rather considerably, e. g. with regard to the distances between the concentric lamellae. The coloration is also, as in Ch. recognita, Sm, very variable; usually the primary colour is light or yellowish, with brown rays or stripes; in the Gulf of Siam, however, entirely white specimens, with dark brown lunules, were taken. The interior of the valves is either quite white or ornamented with dark spots and rays.
