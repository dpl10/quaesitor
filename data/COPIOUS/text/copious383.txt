NOTES OX DIPTEROCARPS. 75 Figures 202 and 203, seedlings of Shorea bracteolata in which the cotyledons had been packed twisted into the shape of an S. 204. Figure 204, inflorescence of Shorea leprosula to show the horizontal aspect of the flower, nat. size ; figure 205, a branchlet slightly enlarged. All the Shoreas kere described except S. bracteolata develop red pigment in tkeir seedlings. S. macroptera and S. Curtisii possess it also in the leaves which follow while they are quite young. Pachynocarpus. In many points the genus P achy no car pus is unlike the other Dipterocarps here under discussion, and in none more so than that the fruits appear fitted for distribution by water. They, in Pachynocarpus Wallichii, are nearly globose, and the calyx is no larger than it was in the flower. The flower is drawn in figures 204: and 205 and the fruit just germinating in figure 206. Thirty-four fruits of the species were collected in the Botanic Garden, Singapore, in November, 1918 and kept in water with the intention of ascertaining how long they would float. The first to sink had floated only five days, the second ten days, but the rest floated various periods from ten to forty-six days ; and the average of the thirty-four was twenty-two days. They germinated as they sank, the stalks of R. A. Soc. No. 81, 1920.
