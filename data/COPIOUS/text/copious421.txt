— 391 — Thwaites — after having named the species Valeria acuminata — discovered that the specific epithet was occupied by Valeria acuminata Hayne and changed the name in mss. to Valeria jucunda. The latter name was taken up by Dyer not by Trimen, as Ashton says) and validly published, no! a nomen as erroneously quoted by Ashton. As Vateria acuminate Hayne is based on a specimen, different from that of Valeria acuminata Thw.. the specific epithet can he used in Stemonoporus.
