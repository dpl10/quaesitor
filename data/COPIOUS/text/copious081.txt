Notes on Dipterocarps. No. 8. On some large-fruited species, and in particular upon the effects of the pressure of the embryo against the interior of the fruit-wall. By I. H. Burkill.

Dipterocarps with large fruits that are not wind-distributed occur in the genera Dryoobalanops, Shorea, Balanocarpus, Vatica, Pachynocarpus and Vateria. By the kindness of Dr. F. W. Foxworthy, I have had material of some of them for study, and one Balanocarpus maximus, King, was the subject of Note no. 5 of this series (Jour. Str. Br. Roy. As. Soc. no. 81, 1920, p. 3')c I am adding in this note observations upon Shorea Thiseltoni, King, and Vatica Ridleyana, Brandis, and also a few remarks upon a Dryobalanops which has the Malay name of " Koladan." The weight of a fruit of Shorea Thiseltoni from the Weld Hill Forest Reserve, Kuala Kumpur, is found to be about 5.5 grammes; that of Vatica Ridleyana from tree no. 815 in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, about 12.5 grammes. Neither is wind-distributed: but falls to the floor of the forest where it may be carried through small distances by rolling or bv animals. Fig. 1, a fruit of Shorea Thiseltoni; figs. 2 and 3, fruits of Vatica Ridleyana. All % nat. size. Shorea Thiseltoni as one of a small number of species in thegenus whose seeds contain oil as well as starch. That having been noticed, an analysis was requested from the Department of Agriculture, Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements, and kindly made through the good offices of Mr. L. Lewton-Brain by Mr. R. 0. Bishop. The following is his report on seeds submitted to him from the Weld Hill Forest Reserve. " A certain number of the kernels were found to be mouldy and were excluded: the remainder were sampled and dried. The dry kernels were extracted for oil-content. The residue from oil extraction was examined for albuminoids and ash. Results: â€” Jour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc, No. 86 1922.
