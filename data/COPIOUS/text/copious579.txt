PHILIPPINE DIPTEROCARPACEAE. 257 F tertiary veins are sometimes irregularly scurfy. Large, branched stellate hairs are often present on the veins, but their occurrence seems to be very irregular. Leaves elliptic, shortly acuminate, on long petioles ; blade 8 to 13 cm long, 4 to 7 cm wide, petioles 3 to 4 cm long ; secondary veins 10^ to IG pairs, alternating with shorter intermediate veins. Tertiary veins parallel, joined by closely reticulate veins. Flowers in drooping panicles ; 'pedicels less than one-haU' the length of the calyx each flower supported by two, oblong, somewhat unequal, 1-to 5-nerved bracteoles Anthers glabrous, the a.vn longer than the anther. Stylopodium bell-shaped pubescent, sometimes slightly constricted above the ovary Fruit globose Lt much-constricted at top, 4 to 15 mm in diameter; calyx-wings 5 to 9 cm long and sometimes more than 1 cm broad, with three prominent longitudinal veins and numerous, more or less oblique, transverse veins. A tree of the lowland forest, ascending to 600 to 750 m above sea ^'It is possible that I am here retaining more than one distinct species under the name of A. thurifera; but, Merill & Rolfe, 1. c., ha., suggested their probable identity and I am unable now definitely to designate distinctive characters for different species. It will take a good deal field work to clear up this matter. There do seem to be two definite types of fruit, one of which is rather large, globose, 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter wJh wings 5 to 7 cm long and more than 1 cm broad, the other with smaller globose fruit, 4 to 8 mm, and longer and narrower wings. I have not been able to discover any constant leaf differences. It may be that the same tree will produce both kinds of fruit; but we do not know that to be the case.  Some of the Malay Peninsula material which is identified as A. glabra certainly belongs to A. thurifera. In the incomplete state of our knowl-edge of these two species, I should hesitate to say whether or not the two are identical, but it is certain that A. thurifera does occur on the Malay Peninsula.
