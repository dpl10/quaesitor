xiii. c, 3 Foxworthy: Philippine Dipterocarpaceae, II \% at the base, attached to base of petals and, more or less, to each other, forming at least an indication of a monadelphous condition. Anthers almost round and equal. Connective prolonged into a tapering awn, distinctly longer than the anther.' Gynoecium hour-glass shaped, the ovary subspherical, the stylopodium as long as the ovary and almost columnar. The stylopodium abruptly narrowed into the style, which is rather less than half as long. The stigma is shallowly notched. Fruit 1 to 1.3 cm long and about 1 cm in diameter, roughly conical, apiculate. Calyx-wings of about equal length and less than two-thirds the height of the fruit. The wood is said to be more durable than that of Molave (Vitex spp.). Luzon, Cagayan Province, near Claveria, For. Bur. 19987 Bernardo, August, 1913 (type). It is also represented by the following specimens: For. Bur. 20453 Bernardo, in flower, May 30, 1913; For. Bur. 1777b, 17775, 17776 Curran, and For. Bur. 20454-All of these are from the same part of the province as the type. The local name is narec. 

The stylopodium resembles that of Hopea helferi Brandis, Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot. 31 (1895) p. 62, t. 2, f. 2, but is relatively longer. The stamens are like those of H. helferi (1. c. fig. 1) and like those figured for H. javanica Burck, Ann. Jard. Bot. Buitenz. 2 (1887) 235, t. 29, f. 7. Some sterile material in the herbarium representing collections in some other provinces may belong here, but the identifications are very doubtful.

 2. BALANOCARPUS BRACHYPTERA sp. nov. Arbor. Folia chartacea, elliptica, oblonga vel ovato-lanceolata, breviter acuminata, basi rotundata vel subcuneata, margine crenulata, glabra, 5.8 ad 7.3 cm longa, 2.7 ad 3.8 cm lata; nervis secundariis 10 ad 12, tertiariis inconspicue reticulatis; petiolo 3 ad 5 mm longo. Fructus ovoideus, circiter 1 cm longus. A medium sized tree. Leaves chartaceous, elliptic or oblong to ovate-lanceolate, apex blunt-acuminate, base rounded or subcuneate, margin crenulate, glabrous except along the principal veins, where there is a sparse pubescence, mainly of grayish pilose hairs, with hairy domatia in the axils of veins on under side of leaf, 5.8 to 7.3 cm long, 2.7 to 3.8 cm wide. Secondary veins 10 to 12 pairs, tertiary veins rather indistinct, mainly reticulate ; petioles 3 to 5 mm long. Flowers unknown. Fruits ovoid, about 1 cm long and 9 mm in diameter, borne in short axillary panicles. Calyx-lobes triangular-ovate, imbricate, rather closely surrounding the fruit, and a little shorter than the fruit. Margins of the sepals frequently brownish and scarious, in one immature fruit, very slightly reflexed. Fruit conical, faintly pubescent, with thin pericarp, the short style projecting through a small circular depression at the apex. Style glabrous, about 0.5 mm. long.
