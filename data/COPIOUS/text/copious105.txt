diameter. Sepals thick, coriaceous, 2.5 to 3 mm long, 1.3 mm wide, almost triangular, densely gray-tomentose. Petals broadly oblong, densely tomentose without and within, about 10 mm long and 6 mm wide, with indications of 7 or 8 principal longitudinal veins ; the petals become irregularly distorted in drying and are hard to straighten out. Stamens 15, arranged in groups, 1.5 mm long, 0.4 mm in diameter, filaments thick and broad at the base, tapering to about 0.3 mm in diameter below the attachment of the anthers; total length of filament about 0.8 mm; anthers ellipsoid, the inner pair smaller than the outer, 0.2-0.3 mm long, connective blunt-conical, projecting beyond the anthers for about 0.1 to 0.15 mm. Ovary rather hemispheric, about 1.7 mm high and 2 mm in diameter, densely grayish tomentose, with indication of division into 3 lobes. Style tapering, cylindric, about 2 mm long, densely grayish tomentose, about 0.4 mm in diameter at the base and 0.2 mm at apex. Stigma apparently capitate and glandular. Ovary 2-celled. Fruit gray-tomentose, ovoid 4 to 5 mm tall, sometimes with the persistent style, often somewhat resinous. The two long wings oblanceolate or oblong, 3.5 to 4.5 cm long, 9 to 10 mm wide, with five principal distinct longitudinal nerves and numerous less distinct reticulate cross veins. Wings pubescent throughout. Short wings lanceolate, about 1 cm long and 1 mm wide, with pubescence so dense as to obscure the longitudinal nerves. 

Luzon, Sorsogon Province, Irosin, 16840 Elmer, August, 1916, (type). Field note: "Medium-sized tree in woodlands along streams at 1,000 feet facing the Pacific. Trunk terete, somewhat crooked, 2 feet thick, 40 feet high, mainly branched toward the top; wood whitish on the outside, moderately hard; bark thick, smoothish and chalky white blotched, ochroleucous otherwise; main branches divaricate, not long but repeatedly branched; leaves chartaceous, con duplicate, descending, slightly paler green beneath, points recurved, fruit wings pale yellowish green, turning dull purple, the nut ovoid, green or yellowish green." This is most nearly related to Vatica lowii King, from which it differs by the smaller size of the fruit, the fewer veins to the leaf, and the much larger size of the flowers. Several other species of this genus seem to be represented in our collections by sterile material. Their identification will have to wait until more complete material is collected.
