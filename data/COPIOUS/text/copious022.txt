il02 JOURNAL, BOMBAY NATURAL HIST. SOCIETY, Vol. XXXlV Cycas are among-the most ornamental plants of tropical and sub-tropical gardens. They are often designated ‘Sago palms’ although they have nothing in common with a palm except the general habit of growth. The beauti-ful, glossy leaves are used for decoration. The Cycadaceae are of very great interest to the Botanist, because they occupy a place intermediate between Phanerogams (the flowering plants) and the Cryptogams, viz., ferns, mosses, etc. There are various species of Cycas culti-vated in the garden, e.g. , Cycas Rumphii, Miq. another indigenous species ; Cycas medica, R. Br. is an introduction from Australia; Cycas revoluta, Thumb, is a native of China and Japan and Cycas siamensis, Miq. from Burma, Siam and Cochin China. The cone of the Cycas circinalis was sent to the Herbarium of the Section of Botany of the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay. Municipal Gardens, D. S.
