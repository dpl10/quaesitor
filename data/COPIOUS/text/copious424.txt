and ready for pollination. No doubt, in the course of time much can beÂ« done toward improving the yield and quality of ilang-ilang oil by intelligent plant selection. Such work requires much patience and at present there are absolutely no data available save a general opinion that the ilang-ilang trees of the wild mountain regions are not as fragrant as the cultivated ones of the lowlands.
CLASSIFICATION OF ILANG-ILANG OIL
It is a well-known fact that ilang-ilang oil, like many other natural perfumes, does not owe its fragrance to any one substance, but is a mixture of a number of odoriferous compounds. It is generally bought and sold on the judgment of the dealers, the determining factor being the odor. Obviously the judgment of various buyers may differ, and consequently it is desirable,  if possible, to value the oil according to analytical tests, so that the purchase and sale may be placed upon an exact analytical basis.
Bacon obtained a number of samples of ilang-ilang oil, mostly from one distillery, the process of distillation being watched and the samples collected by himself. He determined a few of the simple constants of these oils, such as specific gravity (pyknometer)  optical rotation, refractive index, and ester number ; the latter by the usual method, using 1 gram of oil. A few of these results are recorded in Table 31.
