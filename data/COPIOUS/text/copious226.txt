BROWN, A. ALCALA, DIESMOS AND E. ALCALA: PLATYMANTIS

Table 4.
Some advertisement call parameters for Platymantis negrosensis, P. luzonensis, and P. banahao (n  number of voice records, s  seconds).
duration of each note is about 01060-01220 seconds, and the time between notes ranges from about 015 to 054 seconds.
There are usually three to four notes in quick succession following an initial note that is separated by a longer interval (see Fig. 1C and Table 4).
ETYMOLOGY.
The name is derived from Negros, the name of the island where this species occurs.
COMPARISONS.
— Platymantis negrosensis differs from other species of the guentheri Group as indicated in the diagnosis and key.
Ecological Note.
— Of 36 specimens collected in the mountains of southern Negros during field work 1956-58, 28 are from arboreal ferns, 5 from leaf axils of Pandanus, 2 from leaf axils of gabi plants, and Ion the forest floor.
This species occurs in the upper dipterocarp and submontane forest zones at elevations from about 500 to 1050 m. During field surveys in the Lake Balinsasayo area in 1970 and 1972, this species was found in arboreal ferns ranging from about 2-24 m above the forest floor.
RANGE.
— Known only from Negros Island, primarily from populations in the southern mountains.
Only one specimen was recorded from Mt. Canlaon in northern Negros during a field survey in 1962.

Recent samples from populations on various mountains in southern Luzon Island and on Catanduanes Island have added to our knowledge of the variability of this species, but. except for the populations on Mt. Banahao and Mt. Maquiling, the samples are, at this time, too small to determine if they should be treated as subspecies or new species.
We therefore limit the holotype and paratypes to the Banahao-maquiling samples.
Holotype.
— CAS 196368, a female, collected in forest at about 600 m elevation, Mt. Maquiling, Laguna Province, Luzon Island, Philippines, July 11, 1994, by Angel C. Alcala.
Paratypes.
— CAS 196364.
196369-70, 200404-08, 201544-45, 201538-39 Mt. Maquiling; CAS 201218-21 Mt. Banahao at Lucban.
Description of holotype.
— An adult female (measurement in mm): SVL  449, HL  156, HW  188, TIL  203, SNL  62, ED  52, TD  195, 3FL  83, 3FD  35, 3TOD= 17, TIL  203.
A few low tubercles on dorsum, posteriorly; toes about half webbed.
DIAGNOSIS.
— Differs from species of Platymantis of the hazelae and dorsalis Groups in those characters that diagnose the groups.
Platymantis luzonensis differs from species of the guentheri Group, other than banahao, in the skin of snout and dorsum being smooth or nearly so.
It differs from all species but negrosensis in the greater webbing which reaches the distal edge of the basal tubercle on first and second and midway between tubercles on fourth.
It differs from
